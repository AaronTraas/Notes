# Pasta e Fagioli

This is the most basic version of the southern Italian classic. No prociutto, fancy cheese, *mire poix*, etc. Just pasta, beans, garlic, oil, and leftover sauce. Basic, humble, and satisfying. Peasent food at its finest, just like my nonna used to make.

## Ingredients

- ½ lb ditalini or other small pasta
- 2 cans (~15 oz each) of cannellini, white navy, or great northen beans
- ½ cup [tomato sauce](./Tomato-Sauce.html)
- 3-6 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 bay leaf
- kosher salt to taste
- (optional) fresh parsley, chopped
- (optional) red pepper flake

## Directions

1. Add olive oil to pot or dutch oven, heat to medium-low heat.
2. Add garlic, sweat until soft.
3. Add beans, bay leaf, and 2 cups of water. Bring to boil for 5 minutes.
4. Add salt to water as if salting pasta water.
5. Add pasta, sauce and optionally red pepper flake. Boil, stirring occasionally, until pasta is fully cooked.
6. Remove from heat. Add parsley. Serve.
