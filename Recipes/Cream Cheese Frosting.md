# Cream Cheese Frosting

The way my daughter, Miriam, makes Cream Cheese frosting. Great on cinnamon rolls and carrot cake. Or with a spoon.  

## Ingredients

* 8 oz cream cheese softened
* 4 tbsp (1/2 stick) butter, softened 
* 1.5 cups powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Â¼ teaspoon salt (if using unsalted butter)
* 0-2 tbsp milk 

## Instructions

1. Combine butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer or electric mixer and beat until creamy, well-combined, and lump-free.
2. Add vanilla extract and salt and stir well to combine.
3. With mixer on low, gradually add powdered sugar until completely combined. Taste as you go for desired level of sweetness.
4. Optional: add milk to thin it out if it needs it.
