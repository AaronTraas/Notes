* 1 tablespoon (8g) cornstarch

## Hardware

* 5" (single batch) or 7" (double batch) removeable bottom cheesecake pan ([I like these models from Fat Daddio]](https://shop.fatdaddios.com/products/cheesecake-pans))

## Directions:

**Crust**

1. In a bowl, mix graham crackers crumbs, brown sugar, and flour
2. Mix in melted butter until the mixture sticks together.
3. Line the side & bottom of cheesecake pan with parchment paper.
4. Add graham cracker crumbs mixture to cheescake pan. Gently press down the crumbs into the bottom and flatten.
5. Blind-bake crust in a 325°F oven for 15 minutes. Cool completely.

**Batter**

1. Add white sugar, cornstarch, and salt together in a small bowl. Mix to combine.
2. To a second, larger bowl, add cream cheese and mix with electric hand mixer for 10 seconds with a hand on low speed.
3. Add in half the sugar mixture to cream cheese and continue to beat on low speed until just incorporated. Add remaining sugar mixture and continue to beat on low speed until just incorporated.
4. Add sour cream and vanilla extract to the cream cheese mixture. Continue to beat until just incorporated.
5. Add egg(s) one at a time. Continue to beat until just incorporated.
6. Add batter to fully cooled pan with crust.
7. Tap the pan against the counter to let air bubbles rise to the surface. Pop any visible bubbles. Repeat until satisfied.

**Cook, cool, and serve**

1. Place a steamer rack in pressure cooker. 
2. Pre-heat pressure cooker on Saute mode for 5 minutes.
3. Add 1 cup (250ml) of boiling water to pressure cooker. 
4. Add cheesecake pan on the steamer rack in pressure cooker.
5. Seal, and pressure cook for 28 minutes. Wait for natural release.
6. Remove from pressure cooker. Place cheesecake on a wire rack to cool to room temperature.
7. After cooling for 10 – 15 minutes, carefully run a thin paring knife between the sidewall and parchment paper to release the cheesecake from the pan. 
8. Chill cheesecake in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight).
