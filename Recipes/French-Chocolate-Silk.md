# Chocolate Silk Pie

From the [Pillsbury recipe](https://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/french-silk-chocolate-pie/). Similar to chocolate mousse, it's richer and more decadent. 

## Ingredients:

 - 3 oz unsweetened chocolate, cut into pieces
 - 1 cup butter, softened (do not use margarine)
 - 1 cup sugar
 - 4 pasteurized eggs
 - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla

## Directions:

1. Melt chocolate in microwave or double boiler.
2. Beat butter with electric hand mixer or stand mixer until fluffy.
3. Gradually add in sugar and beat until light and fluffy.
4. Beat in chocolate and vanilla until blended.
5. Beat in eggs one at a time until smooth.
6. Pour into fully prepared (cooked if needed) pie shell (or graham cracker crust, or chocolate crumb crust, etc.)
7. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
