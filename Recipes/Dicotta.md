# Dicotta

The was my great-grandmother's cure-all tea recipe, especially for upset stomach and respiritory issues. I'm far less superstitious than your average southern Italian, and am personally skeptical of these sorts of home remedies. However it's warm, comforting, and reminds me of my childhood. It's hot water, which is great when you're congested anyway, and full of whatever nutrients is in the steeping ingredients.

I don't know the source of the word "dicotta". It may be related to the Italian "decotto" or decoction. It may be a local mis-spelling, or something my great grandmother only said, but never wrote down, and was transcribed poorly. I'm not sure.  

## Ingredients:

- 2-3 Chamomile tea bags (or 1/4 cup of dry flowers)
- 2 Marshmallow root tea bags
- 3-4 Dried figs
- 1/4 cup Barley (orzo)
- 1/2 Apple
- (optional) Honey to taste

## Directions:

1. Combine all ingredients into a small sauce pan. Cover this with water 1 inch over the ingredients. 
2. Bring to a boil; simmer for 20 mins. 
3. Strain into a cup and drink hot. Can add honey if needed.
