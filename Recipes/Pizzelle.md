# Pizzelle

My zia often made these for Easter. It's a typical cookie for Easter and Christmas treat in Molise and Abruzzo, and in the US, they seem to be primarily made by Molisano. It is flavored by anise and lemon zest, and should have a strong anise aroma. They are mildly sweet and slightly crisp, and nice with coffee or tea. 

## Ingredients:

- 6 eggs
- 1 cup of sugar
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 3 to 4 cups flour
- 1 cup shortening
- 1 lemon peel
- 2 tsp of anisette 
- 2 tsp vanilla

## Directions:

- Mix everything together into a loose dough 
- Preheat pizzelle iron. Brush griddle with shortening. 
- Place about a tablespoon and press. Cook for 45-90 seconds, or until slightly  browned.
