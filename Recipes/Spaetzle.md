# Spätzle

In progress

## Ingredients:

- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 large eggs
- ¾ cup whole milk
- 4 tbsp melted butter

## Hardware

- 3+ quart pot
- spätzle maker or colandar or grill skillet with 1/4" or larger holes
- mesh strainer or spider
- silicone spatula
- large bowl
- (optional) large skillet

## Directions:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and nutmeg. 
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. 
4. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir to combine. The batter should be fairly wet, slightly thicker than pancake batter.
5. Melt butter in a large bowl
6. Working over the pot of boiling water, press dough through a spätzle maker or colander . Drop dough into the water. When dumplings rise to the surface, use a slotted spoon to transfer a bowl with melted butter and toss.
7. Optionally, heat a pan to medium heat. Toss spätzle in pan to brown.
