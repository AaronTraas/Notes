# Spätzle

In progress

## Ingredients:

- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- ¾ cup whole milk
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt

## Directions:

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt and the nutmeg. 
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. 
4. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir to combine. The batter should be fairly wet, slightly thicker than pancake batter.
5. Spread a clean dish towel flat on a work surface adjacent to the stove. Working over the pot of boiling water, press dough through a spaetzle maker or use a rubber spatula to push it through a colander with holes at least ¼-inch wide. Drop dough into the water. When dumplings rise to the surface, use a slotted spoon to transfer to the towel.
