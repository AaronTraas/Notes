# Perfect Brownies

1 1/2 cup flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
4 eggs
2 cups sugar
4 sq. bakers chocolate
1 1/3 cup shortening
1 cup nuts

Melt shortening and chocolate over double boiler
combine dry ingredients
combine eggs and sugar

Temper the egg/sugar mixture w/some of the melted shortening/chocolate, then carefully combine the egg/sugar w/the chocolate/shortening.
Mix in dry ingredients just to combine. Do not overmix.
Add the walnuts. 
Recipe says to cook at 350 for 20 min. 20 is not long enough in my opinion. You will have soup in the middle. I start for 25 min, then check w/a dry toothpick.
