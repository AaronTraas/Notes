# Baby Back Ribs

Very easy, satisfying rib recipe that you can do easily in the home with no special equipment. Takes some prep, but it's easy, and nearly impossible to mess up. It's not as good as smoked ribs, but gets like 80% of the way there if you use smoked paprika and/or chipotle powder.

## Ingredients

- 2 whole slabs pork baby back ribs

### Dry Rub:

- 8 tablespoons light brown sugar, tightly packed
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon chili powder
- 1 tablespoon spices you like (I like chipotle powder, smoked paprika, oregano, onion powder)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper

### Braising Liquid:

- 1 cup hard cider or white wine
- 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed

## Directions:

1. In a bowl, combine all dry rub ingredients. 
2. Place each slab of baby back ribs on a piece of wide heavy-duty aluminum foil, shiny side down. Sprinkle each side generously with the dry rub. Let sit for at least 1 hour. 
3. Combine all ingredients for the braising liquid. Microwave on high for 1 minute.
4. Preheat oven to 275 degrees.
5. Place the ribs on a baking sheet. Open one end of the foil on each slab and pour half of the braising liquid into each foil packet. 
6. Cook ribs in the oven for 3-4 hours, or until the bones pull away from the meat.
7. Drain braising liquid into a saucepot. reduce on medium heat into a thick glaze. 
8. Cover ribs with glaze. 
9. Finish under broiler or grill.

## Notes:

Based on Alton Brown's [Who Loves Ya Baby-Back?](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/who-loves-ya-baby-back-recipe-1937448) ribs recipe. I reduced the salt as I like to use more rub, and the amount I use makes the ribs too salty with his ratio. Additionally, I increased the baking time, as I like mine to be more of a fall-off-the-bone tenderness.
