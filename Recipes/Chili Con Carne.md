# Pressure Cooker Chili Con Carne

Pretty basic chili con carne. Modified from Alton Brown's [Pressure Cooker Chili](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pressure-cooker-chili-recipe-1942714) recipe. Directions assuming an Instant Pot or similar modern electric pressure cooker. Also, using fresh onions because I always have them on hand, and good salsa is kinda expensive. You can replace the onions, tomatoes, and peppers with salsa if you're in a hurry. Finally, I add beans to my chili, because of health and cost reasons. 

I'd like to develop a version of this that uses dried beans, but that would probably alter the cook time, and require adding water or stock. 

## Ingredients:
- 3 lb stew meat (beef and/or pork)
- 2 teaspoons neutral oil, beef tallow, or lard
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 (12-ounce) bottle of beer, preferably a medium ale
- 30 tortilla chips, crushed into fine crumbs
