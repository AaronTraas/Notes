15. Sprinkle on some corn meal and some flour, and sprinkle some flour underneath the dough to keep it from sticking. Then cut in strips just a little less than an inch then slice the strips into approx. 5-7 mm pieces. Toss by hand in the corn meal so that they are not too slippery.  Roll each piece into a cava with two fingers.
16. Rest them on a lightly floured cookie sheet.
