# Cold Brew Concentrate

In the summer, I make a fair bit of cold brew. I prefer it on a hot afternoon to hot coffee. It's also really great in an [espresso martini](cocktails/Espresso Martini.md).

## Ingredients:

- 12oz (340g) whole bean medium roast coffee
- 17L filtered water

## Hardware:

- Quality burr grinder
- Large 4+ liter plastic vessel (e.g., a [4qt Cambro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001E0KWDA))
- Large [Hario V60 drip brewer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001O0LCUC) + filters 
- Large mesh filter
- Medium bowl or other vessel as a temporary holding place (I use a 16 cup Pyrex measuring cup)
- Storage container (I use mason jars)

## Directions

1. Add water to 4+ liter steeping vessel
2. Grind coffee very coarse - coarser than for french press.
3. Add ground coffee to steeping vessel, and stir.
4. Let coffee steep for 18-24 hours at room temperature.
5. Pour coffee through mesh filter into medium bowl, and discard grounds
6. Set up V60 with filter over your storage container, and pour cold brew through filter. This may take a while, as the fines clog the filter.
7. Seal and store in refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
