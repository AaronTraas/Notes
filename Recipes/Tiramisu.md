# Triamisù

## Ingredients:

- 6 large eggs
- 3 cups (700ml) espresso coffee diluted with 1 cup (240ml) water
- ¾ cup (150g) sugar
- 16 oz (450g) mascarpone cheese
- 16 oz (450g) lady fingers/savoiardi biscuits
- Salt 
- Unsweetened cocoa powder for garnish

## Directions:

1. Separate the eggs, keeping both the whites and the yolks in separate bowls.
2. Add sugar to egg yolks and beat with hand mixer until it turns pale yellow.
3. Add the mascarpone  into the yolk/sugar mixture and mix thoroughly. 
4. Add a pinch of salt to the egg whites. Beat them with the hand mixer to soft peaks.
5. Gently fold the yolk mixture into the white mixture, a little at a time, until fully combined.
6. Add coffee into a shallow bowl. Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the coffee, shake  the excess, and place it in the bottom of a 2-quart dish. Arrange lady-fingers into a tight, single layer which covers the bottom of the dish completely. 
7. Spread a layer of custard over the lady fingers, just enough to cover. Repeat with layers of lady fingers and custard. Top layer should be custard.
8. Refrigerate overnight.
9. Top with a liberal dusting of cocoa powder and serve.
