# Perfect Brownies

These are cakey, not fudgey, brownies. It's not exactly cakey in a fluffy, airy way. It just has a uniform, semi-dry crumb. Like in a good chocolate chip cookie, there's a notably salty component. These are incredibly complex and balanced. 

Yesâ€”this is the opposite what most people want in a brownie. They want them be ultra-moist and fudge-like, and borderline under-cooked. But they are wrong. I was wrong like them too. Then I attained brownie enlightenment. 

The details that set this apart are: the use of cake flour vs. all purpose, more salt than is normal, bakers chocolate instead of cocoa, and  the baking soda. The cake flour makes a difference; it yeilds a slightly lighter-tasting, more refined texture. But all purpose is fine if you don't want to be bothered. The crumb is very short on account of the high amount of fat, including that in the baker's chocolate. The baking soda doesn't exactly provide lift; I assume it's there to counteract the acidity of the chocolate. The extra salt is just good. 

## Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cup cake flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 oz. unsweetened baking chocolate
- 1 1/3 cup shortening
- 1 cup toasted walnuts or pecans

## Hardware
- 9x13" baking pan
- large bowl
- double boiler, or sauce pot and metal bowl
- whisk

## Directions:

1. Melt shortening and chocolate in a double boiler
2. Combine dry ingredients, in a large bowl, set aside.
3. Whisk to combine eggs and sugar
4. Temper the egg mixture with a portion of the melted chocolate mixture, then carefully combine the egg mixture with the chocolate mixture.
5. Add wet ingredients to dry. Mix until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Fold in the nuts.
7. Add to pan.
8. Cook at 350 for 25 min, then check with a dry toothpick until it comes out clean.
