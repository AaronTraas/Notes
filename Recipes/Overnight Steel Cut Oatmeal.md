# Overnight Oatmeal

This ia a really easy, yet filling and satisfying breakfast. You set it up in the slow-cooker the night before, and then serve first thing in the morning. Incredibly rich, nutty, and flavorful. I really love steel cut oats; the texture is far superior to rolled oats for oatmeal. 

The 6 hours on the warm setting is crucial; the oats aren't fully cooked or hydrated. 

## Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup steel-cut oats
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2 cups water
- (optional) 1 baking apple, ripe pear, ripe peach, etc. diced

## Hardware:

- slow-cooker
- wire rack that fits in slow-cooker
- glass baking dish (e.g., Pyrex or similar) that fits in slow cooker

## Directions:

1. Add wire rack and 1/2" water to slow cooker.
2. Combine all ingredients into glass baking dish, and place on wire rack in slow cooker.
3. Cover, and set slow-cooker to low heat for 2 hours, and use the "keep warm" setting for at least 6 hours after that.
4. Stir resulting porridge. Optionally add cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, etc. to taste.

## Notes

- Base recipe here: <https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022119-slow-cooker-steel-cut-oats>
- I like to serve with either a drizzle of heavy cream or buttermilk, and small spoonful of brown sugar
- If you are using an apple or similar fruit, reduce the water by about 1/4 cup
