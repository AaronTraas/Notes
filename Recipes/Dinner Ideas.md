- 1-2 shallots
- 1-2 carrots, diced

### Directions

1. Sautee mushrooms and carrot in oil. After the carrots start to soften, add the shallot to the pan. Cook until soft. Remove or push to side of the pan.
2. Season the chicken pieces heavily with salt and pepper and dust lightly with the flour. Brown chicken in pan. 
3. Deglaze the pan with brandy, add the vegetables back if necessary, stir in the tomatoes, additional wine/brandy to  taste, and enough stock to cover everything. Simmer until the chicken is as tender (about an hour).
