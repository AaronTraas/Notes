# Recipes Aaron likes to cook

I love cooking, especially for other people. The majority of my cooking is done without recipe. Likewise, a lot of the things I cook daily aren't here—roasted root veggies, various stir-fries, various egg dishes, various roasted, broiled, or grilled meats—because I don't really have recipes per se, just ways that I make things, and I tend to use whatever ingredients I have on hand or what looks good at the market. If you want me to show you how to make my family's food or other day to day stuff, and you know me personally, reach out and I'll show you how to make them. 

Most of the recipes listed here are either found on the web and slightly tweaked, or the result of some experimentation. If it is based on another person's recipe online, I'll link to it in the recipe.

## Family Italian Recipes

My maternal family's southern Italian food (from [Monacilioni, Molise, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monacilioni)). This is an attempt to preserve these recipes for my children, and subsequent generations.

## Healthy Recipes

## Sourdough Recipes

I've taken up to making sourdough bread. First, because my daughter likes it, and we didn't go through the gigantic loaves we got at the store quick enough before they spoiled. Then, because it's delicious and fun.

## Desserts

I don't make a whole lot of desserts or sweets. Up until my late 40's, I didn't really bake at all. But here's some stuff that's absolutely worth making.

## Friday-Friendly

As observant Catholics, we abstain from eat meat on Fridays in our household. And yes, we do this year round. This is still in effect, per [Can. 1251](https://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/eng/documents/cic_lib4-cann1244-1253_en.html). Some of these recipes are vegitarian, some par pescitarian, some are neither. [Per the USCCB](https://www.usccb.org/prayer-worship/liturgical-year/lent), broth, rendered fat, gelatin, etc. are not considered meat for purposes of this discipline. Fish and other sea creatures likewise are not considered meat.
