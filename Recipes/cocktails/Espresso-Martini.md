# Espresso Martini

There are many variants of this on the internet, split between versions that use some sort of dairy (usually in the form of Irish cream) and those that don't. I personally prefer the ones that don't, but I want to develop both.

I use cold brew in mine rather than espresso. I want to experiment with either moka pot or Aeropress coffee at espresso strength.

# Mr. Black Espresso Martini 

This tastes like slightly boozy, sweet cold brew coffee in the best possible way. Mostly unchanged from the [Mr. Black website](https://www.mrblack.co/en-us/cocktails/espresso-martini). The only change I've made was using demarara syrup, and halving the amount. It's elegant, smooth, strong, and delicious.

## Ingredients:

- 1 oz cold brew concentrate (I make a 4:1 recipe)
- 1 oz vodka
- 1 oz Mr. Black 
- Â¼ oz [rich demerara syrup](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#rich-demerara-syrup)
- 3 coffee beans (optional garnish)

## Hardware:

- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Coup or Nick & Nora glass (wine glass or cocktail glass is fine)

## Directions:

1. Add cold brew, vodka, Mr. Black, and syrup to shaker 
2. Shake vigorously over ice 
3. Strain into glass. 
4. Optional: garnish with 3 coffee beans floated in the center

# Bright Espresso Martini 

This uses Chambord as both a source of sugar and also a way of simulating the complex bright notes on a nice shot of balanced, medium-roast espresso. Cold brew typically is very low acid and lacks some of the complex aromatic compounds; the Chambord and bitters helps add this back, the former on the pallate, the latter on the nose. 

This also has the added benefit that I don't have to keep simple syrup around. 

## Ingredients:

- 2 oz cold brew coffee (I make an 8:1 recipe)
- 1 oz vodka
- 1 oz Chambord 
- Angostura bitters
- 3 coffee beans (optional garnish)

## Hardware:

- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Coup or Nick & Nora glass (wine glass or cocktail glass is fine)

## Directions:

1. Add cold brew, vodka, and Chambord to shaker 
2. Shake vigorously over ice or frozen cold brew cubes.
3. Strain into glass. 
4. Add 2-3 dashes of bitters.
4. Optional: garnish with 3 coffee beans floated in the center


## Notes:

- If you want a stronger coffee flavor, use frozen cold brew cubes. If you want it a little weaker, use regular ice. 
- You could replace half of the Chambord with Sweet Vermouth and omit the bitters.
