# Black Sheep Mai Tai

The best Mai Tai that Linda and I have tasted was made at  [Black Sheep Bar and Provisions](https://www.theblacksheepnj.com/) in Garwood, NJ. Really fantastic craft cocktails. Their formula differs from the traditional recipe; it forgoes the simple syrup, and the sweetness is provided by a larger amount of orgeat and curaçao. The mix of Planteray 3-Stars and Appleton 8 year rums is just right; enough of the Jamaican funk, and enough of the great balance from the light blend of the 3-Stars. 

## Ingredients:

- 1 oz Appleton Estate 8 Year Old Reserve Rum ([See Note](#notes))
- 1 oz Planteray 3-Stars Rum
- ¾ oz Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao ([See Note](#notes)) 
- ¾ oz lime juice
- ¾ oz orgeat syrup ([See Note](#notes))

## Directions:

- Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker.
- Shake vigorously over ice.
- Add large ice cube to chilled tumbler ([See Note](#notes)). Strain into glass.

## Notes:

- The Plateray 3-Star is a fantastic, complex light rum base. I'm less stoked about the Appleton 8; it's good, but not exceptional. I want to try alternatives.
- I want to try Grand Mariner instead of the Pierre Ferrand, as that's something I stock in my bar anyway.
- Whereas the classic Mai Tai is served over crushed or nugget ice in some sort of tiki cup or collins glass, Black Sheep serves it over a single block of ice in a large tumbler. I'm not sure what difference that makes.
- Black Sheep used Fee Brothers orgeat syrup. I can't find it locally, and after some digging, I found pretty much everyone online finds it lacking. I got a bottle of [Liquid Alchemist Almond Orgeat Cocktail Syrup](https://liquid-alchemist.com/shop/almond-orgeat-cocktail-syrup/) at a local liquor store, and it was fantastic.
- Most of the limes I seem to get are really harsh. I sometimes dial back the lime juice from ¾ oz to ½ oz. I want to experiment with pre-juicing the limes a few hours ahead like they'd do in a bar.
- Linda ordered this on Saturday, October 18th, 2025 at [Black Sheep Bar and Provisions](https://www.theblacksheepnj.com/) whilst killing time before the wedding reception of our dear friends Josh & Monica. I returned a few days later to chat up the bartender

## Ingredients:

- 2 oz Blended Aged Rum (e.g., Denizen Merchant Reserve)
- ½ oz Dry Curaçao
- ½ oz Orgeat
- ¼ oz [rich demarara syrup](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#rich-demerara-syrup) (see notes)

- Spent Lime Shell and Mint Sprig Garnish

## Directions:

- Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker.
- Shake vigorously over ice.
- Pour in glass. Top with ice.
- Garnish with lime shell and mint sprig.

## Notes: 

- As far as the rum goes, there's a lot of recipes. Some people online recommend Denizen Merchant Reserve as the rum. Others call for aged Rhum Agricole.
- Original recipe calls for and "Rock Candy Syrup", which most people think is a 2:1 rich simple syrup.
