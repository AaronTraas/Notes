# Mai Tai

Classic tiki drink. Simple, balanced, and delicious.

# Black Sheep Mai Tai

The best Mai Tai Linda and I have ever had was made at  [Black Sheep Bar and Provisions](https://www.theblacksheepnj.com/) in Garwood, NJ. Really fantastic craft cocktails. Their formula differs from the traditional recipe; it forgoes the simple syrup, and the sweetness is provided by a larger amount of orgeat and curaçao. The mix of Planteray 3-Stars and Appleton 8 year rums is just right; enough of the Jamaican funk, and enough of the great balance from the light blend of the 3-Stars. 
## Ingredients:

- 1 oz Appleton Estate 8 Year Old Reserve Rum
- 1 oz Planteray 3-Stars Rum
- ¾ oz Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao 
- ¾ oz lime juice
- ¾ oz Fee Brother Orgeat
- Lime wheel for garnish
## Directions:

- Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker.
- Shake vigorously over ice.
- Pour in glass. Top with ice.
- Garnish with lime wheel.

## Notes:
- Whereas the classic Mai Tai is served over crushed or nugget ice in some sort of tiki cup or collins glass, Black Sheep serves it over a single block of ice in a large tumbler. I'm not sure what difference that makes.

# Classic "Trader Vic's" Mai Tai

## Ingredients:

- 2 oz Blended Aged Rum (e.g., Denizen Merchant Reserve)
- ½ oz Dry Curaçao
- ½ oz Orgeat
- ¼ oz [rich demarara syrup](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#rich-demerara-syrup) (see notes)

- Spent Lime Shell and Mint Sprig Garnish

## Directions:

- Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker.
- Shake vigorously over ice.
- Pour in glass. Top with ice.

## Notes: 

- As far as the rum goes, there's a lot of recipes. Some people online recommend Denizen Merchant Reserve as the rum. Others call for aged Rhum Agricole.
- Original recipe calls for and "Rock Candy Syrup", which most people think is a 2:1 rich simple syrup.
