# White Elephant

Boozy Thai coconut curry in a glass. Bold, flavorful, complex, and elegant. Probably the best tiki drink I've had.

The key is the Thai cocounut syrup -- the coconut milk, ginger, cilantro, and chilis really balance well. I was most sceptical of the cilantro, but it really works. It's important that you have the syrup age in the fridge for 1-2 days. It mellows the cilantro and brings out the ginger and chilis.

## Ingredients:

- 2 oz rhum agricole or other cane juice rum
- 1Â½ oz [Thai coconut syrup](../Syrups.html#thai-coconut-syrup)
- 1 oz lime juice

## Directions:

1. Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker.
2. Shake  over ice.
3. Pour in glass. Top with ice.
4. Garnish with lime wheel and pineapple frond.
