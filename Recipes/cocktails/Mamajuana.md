# Mamajuana

I bought [this kit from Don Ramon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XTZ7K4L) to make a mamajuana. It came with some recipes.

First step: infuse with 4 Liters of sweet red wine (I used a 4L Carlo Rossi Sweet Red for a whopping $16) for 1 week, then toss the wine.

Second step: infuse with a mixture of rum, honey, and optionally red wine. What I used was based on [austinvn](https://github.com/austinvn)'s success using Captain Morgan's. I did:

- 50% Brugal Anejo rum
- 40% Captain Morgan's spiced rum
- 10% honey

This is supposed to steep for at least 1 month.

The recipes that came with the kit were as follows:

## Don Ramon: Beginner's Sweet Brew

- 60 oz plain or flavored rum
- 12 oz honey or agave

## Don Ramon: Stronger Brew

- 60 oz dark rum
- 12 oz honey or agave

## Don Ramon: Traditional Dominican Style Brew

- 31 oz Spiced or dark rum
- 26 oz sweet red wine
- 15 oz honey
