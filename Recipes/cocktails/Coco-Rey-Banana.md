# Coco-Rey Banana 

This was an excellent drink that a number of us had at Kalahari. 

This recipe as follows gets about 90% of the way there. Still in progress. 

## Ingredients:

- 1 oz aged rum
- 1 oz coconut rum (e.g. Plateray Cut & Dry)
- ¾ oz Banana liqueur (e.g., Tempus Fugit Crème de Banane)
- 1 oz [cream of coconut](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#cream-of-coconut)
- 1½ oz pineapple juice
- 1 oz orange juices
- ½ oz grenadine
- (optional) 5 ml [Acid Adjuster solution](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#acid-adjuster)

## Directions:

1. Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker.
2. Dry shake once to combine.
3. Pour over ice.

## Notes: 

- This was served in tall 24oz cups over ice. [Kalahari Drink Menu PDF](https://www.kalahariresorts.com/media/lepayhnz/pa-cabana-drink-menu-115x11-050624_.pdf)
- [Youtube video with recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tsNY-vKvXQ). Ingredient amounts are from that. It also says to garnish with pineapple spear, pineapple leaf, and grape... by I think a quality maraschino cherry would be better than the grape.
- Best success so far with replacing the white rum with 3/4 oz Bacardi and 1/4 oz Barbancourt 
- Reviews of SelvaRay white rum basically state and it’s evidently good, but nothing too special. Any decent, very smooth white rum with character would do. The SelvaRey coconut is a bit more alcoholic than Malibu, at 30% ABV. 
- I’ve not ever stocked banana liqueur, but various online sources I trust say Tempus Fugit is the way to go.
- Linda and Aaron loved this.
- Original ingredient list:

    - 1 oz pineapple juice
    - 1 oz orange juices
