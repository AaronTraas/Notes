## Aaron's Cocktail Recipes

Cocktail recipes I use, but not necessarily created, that are a little outside the classics. These work for me, and are catered to my tastes and the tastes of the people I love to drink with.

## Cocktails to develop

### From Kalahari

Note, these were made in their tall 24oz cups over ice. Descriptions: [Kalahari Drink Menu PDF](https://www.kalahariresorts.com/media/lepayhnz/pa-cabana-drink-menu-115x11-050624_.pdf)

**Captain's Coco** 
- Captain Morgan Spiced rum
- orange juice 
- pineapple juices
- coconut cream
- nutmeg (on top)
- shredded coconut (on top, not listed in the description)

Notes: very long pour of the Morgan's. Probably at least 4 oz. Probably make more sane sized drinks at 4 oz or so, and start with a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 

Aaron and Austin loved this.

**Coco-Rey Banana**
- SelvaRey Silver rum
- Malibu coconut rum
- Banana liqueur
- Piña Colada mix, 
- pineapple juice
- orange juices
- grenadine

Notes: Ratios unknown; did not observe the bartender making the drink. Assuming as it calls for both piña colada mix and pineapple juice, just coconut cream and pineapple in slightly larger portion? Read reviews of SelvaRay rum, and it's evidently decent, but nothing to write home about. Any decent, very smooth white rum with character would do. I've not ever stocked banana liqueur, but various online sources I trust say Tempus Fugit is the way to go.
