# Hot Toddy 

Classic warming cocktail. Honey, lemon, and hot water are great for a cough. Add whisky, preferably Scotch, and it's especially warming. Also a great way to get rid of that bottle of Jonnie Walker that your friend bought you for your birthday because they heard you like Scotch. Or that bottle of Bowmore you bought on a whim because you saw that it's an Islay whisky for $30. Just theoretical, of course.

## Ingredients:

- 5 oz boiling water 
- 2 oz Scotch whisky (see notes)
- Â½ lemon
- 1 tsp honey
- (optional) small chunk crystalized ginger

## Directions:

1. Add lemon, honey, and ginger to mug, then pour hot water over and stir.
2. Add whiskey stir
3. Optionally garnish with lemon wheel or slice of lemon zest

## Notes:

- Whiskey should be something with some amount of smoke, and a little brininess, but no peat or iodine bomb. Think Jonnie Black or Bowmore, not Laphroig. Nothing too expensive either.
