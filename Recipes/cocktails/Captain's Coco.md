# Captain's Coco 

This was an excellent but potent drink that a number of us had at Kalahari. The secret was a lot of Morgan's. It really needed the rum flavor and the spice. The nutmeg played a big role as well. More refreshing than a pina colada, but hits a lot of the same notes. Also way too easy to drink quickly!

This recipe is a starting point. 

## Ingredients:

- 2oz Captain Morgan spiced rum
- 1oz orange juice 
- 1oz pineapple juices
- 1oz coconut cream
- nutmeg (on top)
- shredded coconut (on top, not listed in the description)

## Directions:

- Add rum, juices, and coconut cream to mixing glass. Stir to combine.
- Pour over ice.
- Garnish with nutmeg and shredded coconut

## Notes: 

- This was served in tall 24oz cups over ice. [Kalahari Drink Menu PDF](https://www.kalahariresorts.com/media/lepayhnz/pa-cabana-drink-menu-115x11-050624_.pdf)
- Observing the bartender making 24 oz drinks with ice, she made a very long pour of the Morgan's. The second time I had it it seemed to have more juice and less rum, and that was worse. Probably at least 4 oz. Served in a 24oz cup over ice. 
- Probably make more sane sized drinks at 4 oz or so, and start with a 1:1:1:1 ratio. 
- Aaron and Austin loved this.
