# Double Perfect Rusty Nail 

The rusty nail first non-girly cocktail I ever enjoyed. (I mean, who doesn't love a good pina colada or frozen daquiry?) I've been made fun of by many a bartender over the years for ordering this, because it's an old man drink, and I was in my 20's when I started. At approaching 50 with lots of gray in my beard, I feel like I'm allowed to have an opinion published on the internet of this drink.

If you like Scotch whisky, but want a cocktail that's cold and a little sweet, this really hits really well. I well made one is just a little bit sweet, a tiny bit smokey, and refreshing. 

The drink is really perfected by the Jonnie Double-Black. It's not the same thing as Black Labelâ€”it doesn't even taste that similar. The stuff is not even that good on its own, but something magical happens when you mix it with Drambuie over ice.
