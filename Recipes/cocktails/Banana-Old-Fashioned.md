# Banana Old Fashioned

Perfectly balanced. The half ounce of creme de banane tempers and adds richness and sweetness to the rye. The walnut bitters is a better fit than angostura, as it adds a rich nuttiness. Fresh grated cinnamon on top adds to the aroma more than the flavor.

## Ingredients:

- 2 oz Rye whiskey
- ½ oz Creme de Banane (Tempus Fugit)
- 4 dashes black walnut bitters
- 2 dashes orange bitters
- 1 dash vanilla extract
- Garnish: slice of banana, fresh grated cinnamon

## Hardware:

- Mixing glass
- bar spoon
- rocks glass or similar

## Directions

1. Add rye, creme de banane, bitters, vanilla, and ice to mixing glass and stir
2. Garnish with orange peel

## Notes:

- Recipe from: <https://www.cocktailcontessa.com/banana-old-fashioned/>
- Tempus Fugit's Creme de Banane is the best in this; the notes of warming spices play well with the rye. Giffard's Banane du Brésil is also quite good, but a little more one note.
- I've had success with two relatively cheap rye whiskeys: Old Forrester 100 and Rittenhouse 100. The higher proof is nice here, as there's a fair bit of the creme de banane to tamp down that peppery rye bite.
