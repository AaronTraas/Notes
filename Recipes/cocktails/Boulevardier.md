# Boulevardier

[Negroni](./Negroni.html), but with bourbon instead of gin. Honestly, I prefer a strong rye to the bourbon. Works great with Old Forrester 100.

## Ingredients: 

- 1 oz Campari
- 1 oz bourbon (or better, rye)
- 1 oz sweet vermouth

## Directions:

1. Stir all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass. 
2. Garnish with a lemon or orange twist.
