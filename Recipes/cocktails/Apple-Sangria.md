# Apple Sangria 

In progress experiment

## Ingredients:

- 750 ml bottle of Chardonnay
- ½-1 cup Spanish brandy 
- 1 cup apple cider juice
- 2 tbsp caramel syrup 
- enough cut fruit (apple, pear, orange, lemon, lime) to make liquid look half full of fruit

## Directions:

1. Dice fruits into 1" pieces
2. Add all liquid ingredients in a pitcher. Stir in brown sugar until dissolved. Taste and adjust—add brandy for strength, sugar for sweetness and/or to reduce alcohol flavor, cider until you can taste it without it overpowering the drink.
3. Mix in fruits. 
4. Refrigerate at least 8 hours, better overnight for 12+. 
5. Serve in wine glass with ice.

## Optional extras:

- Add ice to the pitcher a few minutes before serving, to chill it below refrigerator temp.
