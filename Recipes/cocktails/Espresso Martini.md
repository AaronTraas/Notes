# Espresso Martini

There are many variants of this on the internet, split between versions that use some sort of dairy (usually in the form of Irish cream) and those that don't. I personally prefer the ones that don't, but I want to develop both.

I use cold brew in mine rather than espresso. I do want to develop a version that starts with either moka pot or Aeropress coffee at espresso strength.

# Bright Espresso Martini 

This uses Chambord as both a source of sugar and also a way of simulating the complex bright notes on a nice shot of balanced, medium-roast espresso. Cold brew typically is very low acid and lacks some of the complex aromatic compounds; the Chambord and bitters helps add this back, the former on the pallate, the latter on the nose. 

This also has the added benefit that I don't have to keep simple syrup around. 

## Ingredients:

- 2 oz cold brew coffee (I make an 8:1 recipe)
- 1 oz vodka
- 1 oz Chambord 
- Angostura bitters
- Frozen cold brew cubes or ice

## Hardware:

- Cocktail shaker
- Strainer
- Coup glass (wine glass or cocktail glass is fine)

## Directions:

1. Add cold brew, vodka, and Chambord to shaker 

2. Shake vigorously over ice or frozen cold brew cubes.

3. Strain into glass. 

4. Add 2-3 dashes of bitters. Serve.

## Notes:

- This should froth up when shaken to visually mimic the _crema_ on an espresso shot.
- If you want a stronger coffee flavor, use frozen cold brew cubes. If you want it a little weaker, use regular ice. 
- You could replace half of the Chambord with Sweet Vermouth and omit the bitters.
