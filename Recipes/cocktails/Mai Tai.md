## Notes: 

- Original recipe calls for Smuggler's Cove's Orgeat and Smuggler's Cove Mai Tai syrup. Honestly, probably not worth the effort because I don't make a lot of Mai Tais. The Mai Tai syrup is a 2:1 demerara syrup (which I keep around) that has vanilla and salt added. So I'm just using rich demerara with added vanilla and saline in the drink.
- The smuggler's cove orgeat is also a 2:1 syrup, and since we're using store bought, I'm upping the amount from 1/2 oz to 3/4oz. It needs more sweetness and more almond flavor.
