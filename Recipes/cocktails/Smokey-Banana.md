# Smokey Banana

Mezcal, Chartreuse, and Banana Liqueur? It sounds awful, but is really lovely.
## Ingredients:
- 1 oz creme de banane (preferred, Tempus Fugit)
- 1 oz Mezcal (e.g., Mi Mama Me Dijo)
- 1 oz Green Chartreuse
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- Maraschino cherry and syrup (Amareno or Luxardo)
## Directions

1. Add spirits and lime into a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled.
2. Strain into a glass filled with crushed or nugget ice
3. Add maraschino cherry to garnish, and drizzle a bar spoon of the marinating liquid from the cherries.

## Notes:

- This was introduced to me by [Austin](https://github.com/austin), and he discovered it at [Sogo Hibachi in Denville, NJ](https://sogo.cc/), which has some really phenomenal bartenders. 
- Austin and I are contemplating trying to cut the lime juice down to Â¾ oz, as at 1 oz, the lime is too dominant.
