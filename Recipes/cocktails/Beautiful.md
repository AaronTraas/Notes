# Beautiful (Cocktail) 

This is one of the earlier cocktails my father taught me. He served to to me, alternatively, under the name "French kiss" and "leg spreader", both of which are very different, and much worse drinks. I found in recent years the actual name of this cocktail - the Beautiful. Beauty exists to elevate man's desire for Truth, and at its highest levels, the divine truth, which is to say the one true God. These spirits certainly evoke this.

This drink is all spirit, but somehow doesn't taste as boozy as either ingredients on their own, despite the lack of a mixer, minimal chilling and dilution. It's really easy to drink 3 oz of liquor (hence, "leg spreader"), so be careful!

## Ingredients:

- 1½ oz quality VSOP or older Cognac 
- 1½ oz Grand Marinier 
- large, fresh ice cube (optional)

## Hardware:

- 6-8oz Snifter or tumbler

## Directions:

1. Optionally, add ice to glass
2. Add spirits and barely stir

# Bold & Beautiful 

My preferred variant. A bit drier and more robust. The only difference is the ratio. Strong and straight-forward, yet soft and sweet, like the bold and beautiful love of my life, Linda. 

Use this variant if you have a particularly nice cognac you want to appreciate and shine through.
