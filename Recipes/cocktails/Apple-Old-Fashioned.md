# Apple Old Fashioned

Originally had this, under the name "Midnight Rider" at Saltgrass Steakhouse. Was really good, and perfect for the fall. It really needed the garnish of the thin dried apple slice with cinnamon to make it pop. It was almost paper thin, and had a bit of a toasted/charred flavor.

My only nitpicks: it tasted a little too diluted. They put a lot of small cube ice in it, and it melted quickly. Would be better if it was on a single large cube.

I have to formulate an apple simple syrup. I've seen recipes for simply simmering apple cider until it is a 50 brix syrup. Does this mean I need to be someone that owns a refractometer?
## Ingredients:

- 2 oz Bourbon
- ½ oz Apple simple syrup
- 4 dashes black walnut bitters
- 2 dashes orange bitters
- Garnish: toasted apple slice with grated cinnamon on top
## Directions

1. Add bourbon, syrup, and bitters, and a large ice cube in tumbler and stir.
2. Garnish with apple slice and cinnamon.

## Notes:

- Originally tasted at [Saltgrass Steak House](https://www.saltgrass.com/location/saltgrass-westminster/) in Denver. Their description was as follows: 
  *"**Midnight Rider** - Pendleton Midnight Whisky, Apple Infused Simple Syrup, Orange and Walnut Bitters"*
- Rum variant?
