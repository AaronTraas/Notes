# Hot buttered Rum

Hot and comforting on a cold winter evening. Both the hot nature of the drink and the spiced rum really warm you up from the inside out.
## Ingredients

- 5 oz boiling water 
- 1½ oz dark or demerara or aged rum (see notes)
- 1 oz [hot buttered rum batter (see below)](#hot-buttered-rum-batter)
- Splash of vanilla extract

## Directions:

1. Add batter to mug.
2. Cover with 5 oz hot water, stir vigorously with fork until dissolved and emulsified.
3. Add rum and vanilla. Stir.
4. Optionally float a heavily spiced rum (e.g., [Mamajuana](./Mamajuana.html)) to taste.

## Notes:

- Original recipe: <https://www.seriouseats.com/hot-buttered-rum-recipe>
- Best rum combination I've found is equal parts Smith & Cross and Captain Morgan's, with a splash of [Mamajuana](./Mamajuana.html) floated on top.
