## Notes: 

- This was served in tall 24oz cups over ice. [Kalahari Drink Menu PDF](https://www.kalahariresorts.com/media/lepayhnz/pa-cabana-drink-menu-115x11-050624_.pdf)
- [Youtube video with recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tsNY-vKvXQ). Ingredient amounts are from that. It also says to garnish with pineapple spear, pineapple leaf, and grape... by I think a quality maraschino cherry would be better than the grape.
- Ratios unknown; did not observe the bartender making the drink. 
- Assuming, as it calls for both piña colada mix and pineapple juice, just coconut cream and pineapple in slightly larger portion? 
- Reviews of SelvaRay white rum basically state and it’s evidently good, but nothing too special. Any decent, very smooth white rum with character would do. The SelvaRey coconut is a bit more alcoholic than Malibu, at 30% ABV. 
- I’ve not ever stocked banana liqueur, but various online sources I trust say Tempus Fugit is the way to go.
- Linda and Aaron loved this.
