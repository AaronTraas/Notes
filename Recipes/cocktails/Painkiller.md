# Painkiller

This is an excellent coconut + pineapple cocktail. Heavier on the juice than the Pina colada, and shaken over ice rather than blended.

## Ingredients:

- 2oz aged rum (Pusser's is the "original")
- 2oz pineapple juices
- 1oz orange juice 
- 1oz [cream of coconut](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#cream-of-coconut)
- (optional) 5 ml [Acid Adjuster solution](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#acid-adjuster)
- nutmeg

## Directions:

1. Add rum, juices, and coconut cream in shaker with plenty of crushed ice.
2. Shake vigorously.
3. Pour over ice.
4. Garnish with nutmeg.

# Captain's Coco 

This was an excellent but potent drink that a number of us had at Kalahari. The secret was a lot of Morgan's. It really needed the rum flavor and the spice. The nutmeg played a big role as well. More refreshing than a pina colada, but hits a lot of the same notes. Also way too easy to drink quickly!

And yeah, this is basically a painkiller with Morgan's rather than Pusser's, and less pineapple juice. I've tried a few other spiced rums, and they weren't as good.

## Ingredients:

- 2oz Captain Morgan spiced rum
- 1oz orange juice 
- 1oz pineapple juices
- 1oz [cream of coconut](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#cream-of-coconut)
- (optional) 5 ml [Acid Adjuster solution](./Cocktail-Ingredients.html#acid-adjuster)
- nutmeg
- shredded coconut (optional)

## Directions:

1. Add rum, juices, and coconut cream to mixing glass. Stir to combine.
2. Pour over ice.
3. Garnish with nutmeg and shredded coconut

## Notes: 

- This was served in tall 24oz cups over ice. [Kalahari Drink Menu PDF](https://www.kalahariresorts.com/media/lepayhnz/pa-cabana-drink-menu-115x11-050624_.pdf)
- Observing the bartender making 24 oz drinks with ice, she made a very long pour of the Morgan's. The second time I had it it seemed to have more juice and less rum, and that was worse. Probably at least 4 oz. Served in a 24oz cup over ice. 
- Aaron and Austin loved this.
- I made it without orange juice and double pineapple juice, and was almost as good.
