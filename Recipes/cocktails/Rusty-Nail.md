# Rusty Nail 

The rusty nail first non-girly cocktail I learned to appreciate. (Who doesn't love a good pina colada or frozen daquiry?) I've been teased by many a bartender for ordering "an old man drink" when I started in my 20's. Approaching 50 with lots of gray in my beard, I'm now allowed to have an opinion published on the Internet.

If you like Scotch whisky, but want a cocktail that's cold, balanced, a little sweet, a well made Rusty Nail is the perfect answer.

# Double Perfect Rusty Nail 

The drink is perfected by Jonnie Double-Black. It's not the same thing as Black Labelâ€”it doesn't even taste that similar. The stuff is not even that good on its own, but something magical happens when you mix it with Drambuie over ice.
 
Original recipe from [austinvn](https://github.com/austinvn), who has excellent taste in food and drink.

## Ingredients:

- 1.5-2 oz Johnnie Walker Double-Black 
- 0.5 oz Drambuie 
- large, fresh ice cube
- lemon twist (optional garnish)

## Hardware:

- rocks glass or similar
- bar spoon

## Directions:

1. Add ice to glass
2. Add whiskey and Drambuie and stir
3. Optionally garnish with lemon twist
