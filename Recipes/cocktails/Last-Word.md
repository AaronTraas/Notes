# The Last Word

Boozy, balanced, spirit-forward cocktail that's complex, herbaceous, cool, refreshing, and sophisticated. 
## Ingredients:
- 他 oz Gin (Gray Whale)
- 他 oz Green Chartreuse
- 他 oz Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur 
- 他 oz fresh lime juice
- 1 Maraschino cherry (Luxardo or Amerana)

## Directions

1. Add spirits and lime into a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until chilled.
2. Strain into a coup or similar
3. Add maraschino cherry to garnish. It's fairly standard to drop it in without the toothpick.

## Notes:

- The only one I've had was made at [Black Sheep Bar and Provisions](https://www.theblacksheepnj.com/)).
