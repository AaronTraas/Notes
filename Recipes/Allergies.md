## Celiac/Gluten Free

General strategy is to make stuff that's naturally gluten free -- mostly, no bread or pasta. Dishes that naturally use rice or potatoes as the starch. A lot of Asian, African, Middle Eastern, and Spanish dishes.

### Stuff to watch out for:

- Spice blends
- Soy sauce

### Ideal Substitutions

- Pasta - Jovial and Banza brands
