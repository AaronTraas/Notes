# Bean Ham Bone Soup

## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried navy beans
- 1 ham bone + ham scraps
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, peeled and chopped
- 2-3 carrots, chopped
- 2-3 celery stalks, chopped
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 5+ fresh thyme sprigs
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 10 cups water
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

0. The Night Before: Place the dried beans in a large bowl and cover with three inches of water. Soak the dried beans overnight (up to 24 hours) to soften. Drain when ready to use.
1. Place a large 6 quart pot over medium heat. Add the oil and onions, carrots, and celery sweat until the onions start to turn translucent.
2. Add garlic. Sweat until fragrant, 1-2 minutes.
3. Add ham bone, drained beans, thyme, ground cumin, crushed red pepper, 10 cups of water, and any remaining ham scraps.
4. Bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 60-90 minutes, covered, until the beans are very soft. Uncover and stir occasionally, then place the lid back on top.
5. Add ham scraps and continue to simmer for 5-10 minutes, until ham is sufficiently warm.
6. Discard the bone. Add water if the soup is too thick. Taste, then salt and pepper as needed.
