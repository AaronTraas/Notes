# Syrups

I make syrups for cockatails and other things. Home-made syrups are easy, and you can get things that are hard to find elsewhere.

# Rich Demerara Syrup

This is a 2:1 simple syrup that uses demerara sugar, which gives a lot deeper flavor. A rich syrup also adds better mouthfeel, as the drink is less diluted. Replacing simple syrup with this in certain coctails perfects them, such as my [espresso martini](./cocktails/Espresso Martini.html)


## Ingredients:

- 8 oz Demerara sugar
- 4 oz water

## Directions:

- Add all ingredients to small saucepan.
- Bring to a simmer and stir to dissolve.
- Pour into storage bottle. Keep in refrigerator.
