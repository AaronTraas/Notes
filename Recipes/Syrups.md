# Syrups

I make syrups for cockatails and other things. Home-made syrups are easy, and you can get things that are hard to find elsewhere.

# Rich Demerara Syrup

This is a 2:1 simple syrup that uses demerara sugar, which gives a lot deeper flavor. A rich syrup also adds better mouthfeel, as the drink is less diluted. Replacing simple syrup with this in certain coctails perfects them, such as my [espresso martini](./cocktails/Espresso Martini.html)

## Ingredients:

- 8 oz Demerara sugar
- 4 oz water

## Directions:

- Add all ingredients to small saucepan.
- Bring to a simmer and stir to dissolve.
- Pour into storage bottle. Keep in refrigerator.

# Cream of Coconut

This yields a 1:1 syrup, which winds up being a little less sweet and less cooked tasting than Coco Lopez. 

## Ingredients:

- 1 can Coconut Milk (400 mL)
- 382 grams granulated sugar (a little less than 2 cups)

## Directions:

1. Add coconut milk and sugar to small sauce pan. Heat and stir until sugar is dissolved.
2. Store in refigerator for up to 1 month.

# Thai Coconut Syrup

I only use this, currently, for one drink: the [White Elephant](./cocktails/White Elephant.html). There's probably other uses for this, like glazing a donut, or tossing grilled shrimp in.

## Ingredients:

- 1 can Coconut Milk (400 mL)
- 382 grams granulated sugar (a little less than 2 cups)
- 100 grams chopped ginger
- 2 tbsp chopped cilantro
- 1 thai chili or chili de arbol

## Directions:

1. Add coconut milk and sugar to small sauce pan. Heat and stir until sugar is dissolved.
2. Add coconut milk and sugar mixture to blender. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend until smooth.
3. Filter through a fine mesh strainer.
4. Filter again throught a metal coffee filter.
5. Store in refigerator for at least 24 hours, or up to 1 month.
