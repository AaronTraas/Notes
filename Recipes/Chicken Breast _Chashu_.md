# Chicken Breast "Chashu"

Not really Chashu, but a good substitute for a chicken paitan ramen topping, or just to snack on out of the fridge.

This is based on [Way of Ramen's recipe](https://youtu.be/NcKHzDzi4n4?si=76pjGDlsMt5TAzAy). This is based on an equilibrium brine. Make multiples of everything exactly. Because the brine will be ideal at equilibrium, you can't soak it for too long. 

## Ingredients:

  * 1kg lbs. boneless skinless hicken breast
  * 1 L water
  * 50g salt
  * 25 g sugar
  * 1 3"x3" piece of kombu per chicken breast
  * Large bowl of ice water 

## Directions:

  1. Preheat a water bath to 63° C/ 145° F using a sous vide water circulator.
  2. Combine mirin, soy sauce, water, and brown sugar in a microwave safe vessel. Heat in microwave until hot enough to dissolve sugar. Stir. Cool to room temperature or below.
  3. Add all ingredients to either a vaccuum bag or ziplock bag. Remove air and seal.
  4. Cook pork belly for 12 hours in water bath.
  5. Remove from water bath and transfer bag into ice water until the pork is at room temperature.
  6. Place in refridgerator for at least 6 hours.
  7. Slice straight from the fridge while still cold (it's too soft to slice easily when it's warm). 
  8. Optional - place slices on a sheet pan and char with a propane torch -- the kind you get from the hardware store for sweating pipes, not the wimpy kitchen butane torches.

## Notes:

  * This is based on Ramen Lord's recipe for sous vide chashu pork from his [Book of Ramen](https://www.reddit.com/r/ramen/comments/hv9niv/my_brother_and_i_just_completed_a_free_ebook_on/). 
  * The changes I've made:
      - I added a bit less water to reduce the total liquid overall, because my vacuum sealer doesn't do well with lots of liquid. 
      - I  don't sear the pork ahead of time. It does result in slightly more flavor if you do, but it's so much easier this way, and it's not that different. I sometimes sear the sliced pieces with a propane torch before serving. 
      - His recipe says for 7-12 hours. It's fully cooked at 7, but even at 10, the fat isn't quite melty enough for my taste, so I went with 12.
  * Tip: save the gelatinous gelatinous and fatty liquid that's in the bag -- it's delicious stuff. If you add additional salt to it, it can function as a tare for your ramen.
