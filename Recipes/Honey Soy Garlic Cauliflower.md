# Honey-Soy-Garlic Cauliflower

**Note to Linda** - when you made this last, there was way too much soy sauce. I cut the amount in half in the recipe. I also reduced the sriracha and added red pepper flake. Consider using sambal instead if you have it; it's a garlicky spicy sauce. We thought it could use more acid, so I added a lime.

## Ingredients:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups panko breadcrumbs
- 3 large eggs, beaten
- 1 head cauliflower, chopped into bite-size florets
- 2/3 cup honey
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 3 limes, juiced
- 1 Tbsp. sriracha
- 2 tsp. red pepper flake
- 1/2 cup water
- 4 tsp. corn starch
- 1/4 cup sliced scallions (garnish)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F 
2. Line a large baking sheet with foil 
3. Cobine flour, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
4. In a large bowl, cauliflower and toss in seasoned flour mixture until fully coated.
5. In one small bowl or tray, add panko breadcrumbs. In another, whisk eggs and and 2 tablespoons water. 
6. Dip cauliflower in beaten eggs, then panko until fully coated, and place in prepared baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper.
7. Bake at 400°F until golden and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes.
8. In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water, until the cornstarch dissolves completely. 
9. To a small saucepan, add soy sauce, honey, garlic, lime juice, Sriracha, and chili flake. Bring to a boil over medium heat.
10. Reduce heat and add the cornstarch slurry. Bring to simmer again and cook until sauce thickens, about 2 minutes.
11. Toss cooked cauliflower in sauce until evenly coated. Return the cauliflower to baking sheet and broil on high for 2 minutes.
12. Garnish with scallions and serve.
