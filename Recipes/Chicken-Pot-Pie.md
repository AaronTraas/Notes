# Chicken Pot Pie

Linda's chicken pot pie recipe.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb skinless, boneless chicken breast, cubed
- 1 cup sliced carrots
- 1 cup frozen green peas
- ½ cup sliced celery
- ⅓ cup chopped onion
- ⅓ cup butter
- 1 russet potato, diced (optional)
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp black pepper
- ¼ tsp celery seed
- 1¾ cups chicken broth
- ⅔ cup milk
- 2 unbaked pie crusts 

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F
2. In a saucepan, add chicken, carrots, peas, and celery. Add water to cover and boil for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain and set aside.
3. Sweat onions in butter until soft and translucent. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick. Remove from heat.
4. Place the chicken mixture in bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown. 
6. Cool for 10 minutes. Serve.
