# Pressure Cooker Rice

The best way to make rice at home is with a [fancy rice cooker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00007J5U7). Or a [cheap rice cooker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0979TYRYN). But I don't cook enough rice or have a big enough kitchen to justify owning one. If you do, go for it! 

What I do have is an Instant Pot. The "Rice" button on the device does a terrible job, producing slightly wet, gummy rice. However, the Internet has a better way: pressure cook the rice! For Jasmine or Basmati or other long-grain rice, rinse rice until water runs clear, drain, add 1:1 water to rice ratio by volume to the pot, pressure cook on high for 3 minutes, and natural release. That's it! 

I have some specific recipes that add a little style to your dish.

# Basic Long Grain Rice

Works with most long/medium grain rice. Basmati, Jasmine, Carolina, etc. 

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup  rice
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1. Rinse rice under cold water to wash the starch off. Repeat until water runs clear. Drain.
2. Add rice, water, and salt to pressure cooker. Stir. 
3. Seal pressure cooker, and pressure cook on high for 3 minutes without the "keep warm" enabled. Wait for natural release, at least 15 minutes.
4. Open lid, fluff with wooden spoon or plastic paddle, and serve.

# Indian Restaurant Rice

Ever get that really fragrant basmati rice from an Indian place served with your dish, and wonder how they do it? This is not it, but it gets you 95% of the way there on a weeknight while your curry is simmering in the pan.

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1 cup water
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon ghee (or regular butter)
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 star anise pod

## Directions:

1. Rinse rice under cold water to wash the starch off. Repeat until water runs clear. Drain.
2. Add rice, water, cumin, and salt to pressure cooker. Stir. Add ghee, star anise pod, and bay leaf on top.
3. Seal pressure cooker, and pressure cook on high for 3 minutes without the "keep warm" enabled. Wait for natural release, at least 15 minutes.
4. Open lid, remove star anise pod and bay leaf, and either discard or use for garnish. Stir with wooden spoon or plastic paddle, and serve.

## Notes:
* Makes your kitchen smell amazing when you open the lid. Everyone present will want to eat immediately.
* Goes great with [Chicken Tikka Masala](Chicken%20Tikka%20Masala.html)
