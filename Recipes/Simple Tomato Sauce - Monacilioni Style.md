# Simple Tomato Sauce - Monacilioni Style

## Ingredients
- 28 oz canned or fresh processed tomatoes (see Notes)
- 1 medium onion, roughly diced
- 1-4 medium garlic cloves, crushed, sliced, or finely minced (your preference
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Basil, fresh or dried.
- 1-2 Turkish Bay leaf
- Salt
- Optional: 1/2 cup wine, or 1oz vodka
- Optional: Fresh Italian parsley

**Hardware**
- 3+ quart stock pot or enameled dutch oven (non-reactive!)
- Wooden spoon or silicone spatula

## Directions
1. **Prepare the pan:** Put pan on stove on medium-low heat. Coat in olive oil.
2. **Sweat onions:** Add onions to pan, sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Cook gently until extremely soft and translucent. The onions should not brown. (Note: this is the final texture the onions will get, as this is a quick sauce that doesn't simmer all day.)
3. **Add garlic:** Add garlic to pan, and sweat until translucent and fragrant.
4. **Add tomatoes:** Add tomatoes, most of the basil and/or parsley, and alcohol.
5. **Cook tomatoes:** Turn the heat to medium-high, stirring frequently. Bring tomatoes to a light boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer. The tomatoes should be just barely bubbling.
6. **Simmer and adjust:** Stir the tomatoes every 5 minutes or so. Taste, add salt or olive oil as needed (in very small additions -- the sauce will cook down and concentrate the flavors). Simmer for 30-45 minutes.

### Serving:

When sauce is completed, if you are serving right away, add a ladel or two of pasta water into the pan, and reduce for another 2-5 minutes. Toss immediately over pasta. Don't add too much sauce to the pasta! Serve it on the side, or refrigerate the rest and use it left-over for another meal.

Not traditional, but better if you're serving a small group: a skillet to medium-high heat, and coat with a thin layer of olive oil. Add 1 cup of sauce per 1/2 pound of pasta. Heat for 1 minute. Add pasta that is 1-2 minutes under-cooked directly from the boil, along with 1-2 ladles of pasta water, to taste. Cook and stir until pasta is done and the sauce is at your desired consistency.
