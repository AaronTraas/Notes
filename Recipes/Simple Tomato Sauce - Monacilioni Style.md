# Simple Tomato Sauce - Monacilioni Style

This is my variation on my nonna's simple tomato sauce. All of the women in the family that I've met make some minor variaiton on this. My mother's family is almost entirely from [Monacilioni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monacilioni), and this style of sauce is common in various rural parts of Molise, and much of the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. I've met people from Abruzzo, Campagna, and Puglia that all have similar family sauces. 

This is a simple, rustic, and fresh sauce. The flavor of the tomatoes is the most important here. It should be fruity, mildly sweet, and aromatic. It is cooked fairly quick and short, and can be thrown together on a weeknight. It can be used as a base for other sauces based on what you have around -- meat, fish, carrots and celery, etc. 

Note that I don't cook from a recipe. I learned to make this from watching my nonna, and then reverse-engineering what I remembered while I was living in my college dorm. My main variation from my nonna is the addition of alcohol, which acts as a solvent for alcohol-soluable flavors in the tomatoes. I'm writing it down here for posterity, mostly for the sake of my two beautiful daughters, who I hope will continue making this and pass it down to their children. This is meant to be done by taste, feel, and experience. You want a sweeter sauce? Add extra onion and/or a chicken leg. Less pungent? Reduce the garlic, or process them less. You have beautiful herbs -- fennel fronds, marjoram, taragon -- try adding them in small quantities. Proper Italian cooking is more about love and taste than precision. 

## Ingredients
- 28 oz canned or fresh processed tomatoes (see Notes)
- 1 medium onion, roughly diced
- 1-4 medium garlic cloves, crushed, sliced, or finely minced (your preference)
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- Basil, fresh or dried.
- 1-2 Turkish Bay leaf
- Salt
- Optional: 1/2 cup wine, or 1oz vodka
- Optional: Fresh Italian parsley

**Hardware**
- 3+ quart stock pot or enameled dutch oven (non-reactive!)
- Wooden spoon or silicone spatula

## Directions
1. **Prepare the pan:** Put pan on stove on medium-low heat. Coat in olive oil.
2. **Sweat onions:** Add onions to pan, sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Cook gently until extremely soft and translucent. The onions should not brown. (Note: this is the final texture the onions will get, as this is a quick sauce that doesn't simmer all day.)
3. **Add garlic:** Add garlic to pan, and sweat until translucent and fragrant.
4. **Add tomatoes:** Add tomatoes, most of the basil and/or parsley, and alcohol.
5. **Cook tomatoes:** Turn the heat to medium-high, stirring frequently. Bring tomatoes to a light boil, then turn down the heat to a simmer. The tomatoes should be just barely bubbling.
6. **Simmer and adjust:** Stir the tomatoes every 5 minutes or so. Taste, add salt or olive oil as needed (in very small additions -- the sauce will cook down and concentrate the flavors). Simmer for 30-45 minutes.

### Serving:

When sauce is completed, if you are serving right away, add a ladel or two of pasta water into the pan, and reduce for another 2-5 minutes. Toss immediately over pasta. Don't add too much sauce to the pasta! Serve it on the side, or refrigerate the rest and use it left-over for another meal.

Not traditional, but better if you're serving a small group: a skillet to medium-high heat, and coat with a thin layer of olive oil. Add 1 cup of sauce per 1/2 pound of pasta. Heat for 1 minute. Add pasta that is 1-2 minutes under-cooked directly from the boil, along with 1-2 ladles of pasta water, to taste. Cook and stir until pasta is done and the sauce is at your desired consistency.
