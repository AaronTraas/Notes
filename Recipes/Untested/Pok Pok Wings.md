# _UNTESTED_ Pok Pok Wings

## Ingredients:

- ½ cup Vietnamese fish sauce  
- ½ cup superfine sugar  _(or just regular white sugar)_  
- 4 garlic cloves, 2 crushed and 2 minced ( _we used about 4 heads of garlic, divided_)
- 3 pounds chicken wings split at the drumettes ( _We used drummets and wings and find it's easier to fry._)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for frying  
- 1 cup cornstarch  
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro  
- 1 tablespoon chopped mint
 
## Directions:

1. In a bowl, whisk the fish sauce, sugar and crushed garlic. Add the wings and toss to coat. Refrigerate for 3 hours, tossing the wings occasionally.
2. Heat the 2 tablespoons of oil in a small skillet. Add the minced garlic; cook over moderate heat until golden, 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels.
3. In a large pot, heat 2 inches of oil to 350°. Pat the wings dry on paper towels; reserve the marinade. Put the cornstarch in a shallow bowl, add the wings and turn to coat lightly. Dust off any extra. Fry the wings in batches until golden and cooked through. Drain on cooling rack and transfer to a bowl.
4. In a small saucepan, simmer the marinade over moderately high heat until syrupy  _(see photo above)_. Strain over the wings and toss. Top with the cilantro, mint and fried garlic and serve.
