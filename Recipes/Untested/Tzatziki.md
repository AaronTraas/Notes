# Tzatziki

## Ingredients:

- 16oz cup of Plain 5% Greek Yogurt (e.g. https://usa.fage/products/yogurt/fage-total-5#product-211)
- 1 medium sized cucumber
- 2 cloves garlic (you can add more to taste, but be cautious; it's going in as a raw paste and thus has a very strong flavor)
- 1 lemon
- 1 package of mint (about a handful of leaves. May want to reserve 1 leaf for garnish)
- EVOO

## Instructions:

1. Peel off most of the cucumber's skin (you can leave some stripes behind, I think it adds to the aesthetics of the final dish).

2. Finely grate the cucumber. Wrap the cucumber shavings into a paper towel and squeeze tightly until water stops coming out (there will be a lot of water. By the time you're done the cucumber volume will be reduced to about 1/4 original)

2b. I found that the cucumber was a little stringy last time I made it, next time I'm thinking of dicing it up a bit with a knife at this stage.

3. Convert garlic to paste. Finely mince mint leaves.

4. Combine all ingredients and stir thoroughly: yogurt, de-watered cucumber, garlic paste, juice of 1 lemon, minced mint, salt and EVOO to taste (about 2 tsp salt, 1 tbsp EVOO)

5. Ready to eat as is, or can be refrigerated for several days. I like to reserve 1 mint leaf, coarse dice just before serving and use as garnish.
