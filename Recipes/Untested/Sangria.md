Ingredients:

2 bottles red wine - traditionally it should be a Spanish wine, but I find it doesn't make a big difference. I use cheap Carbernets and/or red blends.

1-2 cups brandy, depending on how strong you want it. Traditionally it should be a Spanish brandy, but a good one is hard to find in the US, a cognac may work as a substitute. Nothing too fancy, you just want a decent one that does not taste like rubbing alcohol, as I find many cheap American brands do. Something reasonably smooth with some flavor to it. I use Osborne Solera Veterano, which can be difficult to find.

1-2 cups orange juice. Careful with the volume, you want to taste the orange without it overpowering the alcohol. Amount you use will depend on amounts/strength of flavor of your alcohol.

Around 2-4 tbsp brown sugar, to taste. Maybe more if you want to mellow out the alcohol flavor a bit.

Fruits: (amounts are flexible, will not have a dramatic effect on flavor, just keep adding them until the liquid mix looks about half full of fruit)

1 navel orange

1-2 apples (something with flavor, like gala or granny smith)

1-2 lemons

1-2 limes


Steps:

1. Dice fruits into small pieces, about the size of a d20

2. Mix all liquids in a pitcher, stir in brown sugar. Taste and adjust - add brandy for strength, sugar for sweetness and/or to reduce alcohol flavor, OJ until you can taste it without it overpowering the drink.

3. Mix in fruits. Refrigerate at least 8 hours, I like to do it overnight for 12+. It will remain good to drink for a couple days after mixing.


Serving:

Serve in a wine glass with ice.

Optional extras:
Add more ice to the pitcher a few minutes before serving, to chill it below refrigerator temp.
Add a dash of sprite on top to make it fizzly without changing the flavor much, if your patrons enjoy that sort of thing.
Add a fresh orange slice to each glass if you want it to look fancy.


This makes the equivalent of about 3 wine bottles' worth of alcohol, so you can estimate your needs and scale it based on that.
