# Sangria 

This makes the equivalent of about 1L of sangria. It is best made at least 12 hours in advance. It will remain good to drink for a couple days after mixing.

## Ingredients:

- 1 750 ml bottle of robust red wine
- 1/2-1 cup Spanish brandy 
- 1/2-1 cup orange juice
- 1-2 tbsp brown sugar 
- enough cut fruit (apple, pear, orange, lemon, lime) to make liquid look half full of fruit

## Directions:

1. Dice fruits into 1" pieces

2. Add all liquid ingredients in a pitcher. Stir in brown sugar until dissolved. Taste and adjust - add brandy for strength, sugar for sweetness and/or to reduce alcohol flavor, OJ until you can taste it without it overpowering the drink.

3. Mix in fruits. 

4. Refrigerate at least 8 hours, better overnight for 12+. 

5. Serve in wine glass with ice.

## Optional extras:

- Garnish with a fresh orange slice in the glass.
- Add more ice to the pitcher a few minutes before serving, to chill it below refrigerator temp.
- Add a dash of sprite on top to make it fizzly without changing the flavor much, if your patrons enjoy that sort of thing.

## Notes:

- *Wine:* traditionally it should be a Spanish wine, but I find it doesn't make a big difference. I use cheap Carbernets and/or red blends.

- *Brandy:* depending on how strong you want it. Traditionally it should be a Spanish brandy, but a good one is hard to find in the US, a cognac may work as a substitute. Nothing too fancy, you just want a decent one that does not taste like rubbing alcohol, as I find many cheap American brands do. Something reasonably smooth with some flavor to it. I use [Osborne Solera Veterano](https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/osborne+veterano+solera+brandy+andalucia+spain/1/usa-7065-200), which can be difficult to find.

- *Orange juice:* Careful with the volume, you want to taste the orange without it overpowering the alcohol. Amount you use will depend on amounts/strength of flavor of your alcohol.

- *Brown sugar:* to taste. Maybe more if you want to mellow out the alcohol flavor a bit.

- *Fruits:* amounts are flexible, will not have a dramatic effect on flavor, just keep adding them until the liquid mix looks about half full of fruit
