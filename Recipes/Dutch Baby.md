Aaron's favorite topping:
In a medium-sized microwave-safe mixing bowl, add 1.5 cups fresh blueberries.
Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon cornstarch onto blueberries. Toss to coat evenly.
Add 1/2 tablespoon butter.
Microwave for 1 minute, 30 seconds. Stir gently. If needed, microwave for additional 30 seconds. Repeat as needed.

based on Martha Stewart's dutch baby pancake recipe
Original recipe called for 1/2 cup flour. Replacing some of the flour with cornstarch makes exterior crispier and interior less mealy.
Speed is of the essence; you're adding the batter to the hot skillet while it's still in the oven, and you don't want too much heat to be lost
You should be doing this anyway; step 0 is always mise en place!
