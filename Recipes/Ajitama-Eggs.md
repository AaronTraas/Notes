# Ajitama Eggs

My second favorite ramen topping, after [chashu pork belly](Chashu-Pork-Belly.html). Also, very tasty by themselves. I've made them with both hard and soft boiled eggs. A 7 minute soft boiled is just about perfect.

## Ingredients

- 6 hard/soft boiled eggs, peeled
- 300mL Soy Sauce
- 300mL Mirin
- 300mL sake (or sub for 200mL water + 100mL rice vinegar)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp hondashi or fish sauce
- optional: garlic, ginger, white parts of green onions

## Directions

1. Combine all ingredients, except for eggs, into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil. Immediately take off heat. 
2. Transfer to container that the eggs will marinate in, and let cool to room temperature. 
3. Put eggs in bowl, place paper towel in vessel in contact with the eggs, so the tops marinate evenly.
4. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8-48 hours. 

## Notes

- Tip: marinade can be re-used for multiple batches of eggs. Every week or two, re-boil it, and top it off with more shoyu/mirin/hondashi.
- If you're short on time, or feeling lazy, replace the sugar with simple syrup, and skip the boil.
