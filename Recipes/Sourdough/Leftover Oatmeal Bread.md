# Leftover Oatmeal Bread

![Oatmeal Bread](../../images/oatmeal_bread.jpg)

This was a recipe I came up with to use about 1.5 cups of prepared overnight (steel cut) oatmeal I had leftover. It was really tasty. I found a recipe online, and modified it to work with sourdough.

You may need to add more flour -- possibly a lot more -- to get the dough texture right. It's hard to calculate for how much water is in your oatmeal.

## Ingredients:

- 1.5 cups of leftover [steel-cut oatmeal](../Overnight%20Steel%20Cut%20Oatmeal)
- 250g / 2 cups bread flour
- 180mL / 3/4 cup water
- 25g / 1/8 cup brown sugar
- 50g sourdough starter (or discard)
- 5g / 1 tsp salt

## Hardware:

- large mixing bowl
- bench scraper
- wooden spoon or dough whisk
- loaf pan

## Directions:

1. In mixing bowl, stir oatmeal, water, sugar, and sourdough starter together enough to break up oatmeal. Let mixture sit on counter for 15 minutes.
2. Add 1 cup of flour and stir to combine into a wet dough, about 1 minute. Add additional flour, mixing well after each addition until the dough comes together into a rough dough. This may take 2 cups, or it may take 3+, depending on the moisture in the oatmeal. Stir until all the flour is incorporated, and the dough is only slightly sticky.
3. Cover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Knead for 3-5 minutes on a well-floured work surface. Add more flour as needed to prevent sticking.
5. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Add salt, and knead on well floured work surface for 3-5 minutes. Add more flour as needed. Dough should not be sticky.
7. Let dough rise until doubled. If you're using discard, this will probably take a while. If you're using ripe starter, this can be done overnight in the fridge, or 1-3 hours at room temperature.
8. Prepare pan by spraying with baking spray, and optionally making a parchment sling for easy removal.
9. Punch down, transfer to well floured surface. Flatten into a rectangle, and roll into a loaf the size of your pan.
10. Sit at room temperature to rise until doubled.
11. Pre-heat oven to 375°F.
12. Optionally top crust with rolled oats, nuts, seeds, or flour.
13. Put pan in oven for 30 minutes. Check for doneness (should be 195°F-200°F). Cook longer if needed.
14. Remove from pan, and cool on wire rack for at least an hour before slicing.
