# Starter feeding/care

The feeding cycle is 12-24 hrs at room temperature, 1-2 weeks in the fridge. Look for it to double in size and then die down a bit. To start the next cycle, combine equal parts by weight starter, flour, and tepid water. Any flour is good. Mix to an even consistency. 

Store in a container that can handle a little expansion. A glass jar with a tight lid could actually explode from the pressure.
