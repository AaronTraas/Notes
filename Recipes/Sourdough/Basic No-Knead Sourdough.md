# Basic No-Knead Sourdough

Schedule for baking on Friday:

TUESDAY PM: 
Take out 50g. Feed at 50/50/50 to begin building dough. Leave out.
Also refeed the remaining starter at 40/40/40 and refrigerate for next week. (120 grams will give you 50&40 next week without having to scrape every last bit out of the container. 35/35/35 is probably enough if you want to save a whole penny every week.)

WEDNESDAY AM feed again: 150/150/150

WEDNESDAY PM:
In a big bowl:
400-450g starter
720g bread flour
1.75 cups water
I mix by hand. It's extremely sticky so only use one hand or you're going to have trouble cleaning up. 

 cover, sit 30-60 min

Add heaping TBS salt, wet hands in warm water.
fold in half in the bowl a bunch of times, but try not to tear it. 
sit 30-60min
Back into fridge overnight 2 nights covered

FRIDAY
Out of fridge.
separate into 2 (or 4) pieces on a floured surface.
stretch and fold a few times
Leave seam-side-down so they hold together 
Flour the tops enough to prevent sticking and cover with a towel
leave out 20 min covered to come to room temp
final shape: I flip it upside down and then mostly kind of stretch corners away from the center and fold them in. After a few of these it gets harder to continue and you have a nice ball. Don't tear it and try not to completely deflate it either. 
Where the seam from the folds come together is the bottom of the loaf, leaving a nice smooth top.

into proofing baskets (upside-down, aka seam-side-up): these days I like to do 4 loaves and store them in some smaller deep round bowls that are just big enough to hold them. You have to line the bowls or baskets with cloth that has a generous amount of flour to prevent sticking. 

Search ”proofing baskets” on Amazon to see what you're going for in terms of bowl and liner.

rise 3 hours covered with a towel

At 2.5 hrs, put dutch oven into oven and pre-heat to 475
Flip bowl over onto parchment paper to remove dough from bowl
Put into dutch oven on parchment paper
score with razor blade. I like to make an X on top.
bake covered at 475 23min
uncover, 
Optional: move to a cold baking sheet, still on parchment paper (this helps the bottom not to burn)
bake 21min
Crust should be pretty dark brown
Place on a rack to cool

For 4 loaves, cooking two at a time: use same time in oven.
