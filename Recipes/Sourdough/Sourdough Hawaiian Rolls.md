# Sourdough Hawaiian Rolls

Adapted from my [Lean Sourdough Dinner Rolls](./Lean%20Sourdough%20Dinner%20Rolls.html) recipe, which is really great. Also inspired by [Sourdough Hawaiian Rolls](https://www.farmhouseonboone.com/sourdough-hawaiian-rolls), which calls for a lot of mixing in a stand mixer, which I don't own or have space for.

Still in development. Replaced the water from my dinner roll recipe with pineapple juice and milk. I also added butter and an egg, and increased the sugar. Because of the butter and increased sugar, it browns a little too easily, so I decreased the temperature to 350°F.

Yeild is 16 tall rolls or 32 normal size. I usually do the tall ones because of the pans I have available.

## Ingredients:

- ~4 cups bread flour
- 180mL (6oz can) pineapple juice
- 180mL whole milk
- 65g (1/3 cup) sugar
- 100g sourdough starter or discard
- 15g / 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 3 tbsp softened butter
- 2 tbsp melted virgin coconut oil or butter

## Hardware:

- large mixing bowl
- bench scraper
- wooden spoon or dough whisk
- 2x loaf pans or larger baking dish

## Directions:

1. In mixing bowl, juice, milk, sugar, eggs, and sourdough starter together. Let mixture sit on counter for 15-30 minutes.
2. Add 1 cup of flour and stir to combine into a wet dough, about 1 minute. Add additional flour, mixing well after each addition until the dough comes together into a rough dough. This may take 2 cups, or it may take 3+. Stir until all the flour is incorporated, and the dough is only slightly sticky. When the dough starts to come together, kneed in butter
3. Cover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
4. Knead for 5-10 minutes on a well-floured work surface. Add more flour as needed to prevent sticking.
5. Cover and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.
6. Add salt, and knead on well floured work surface for 5-10 minutes. Add more flour as needed. Dough should not be sticky.
7. Let dough rise until doubled. If you're using discard, this will probably take a while. If you're using ripe starter, this can be done overnight in the fridge, or 1-3 hours at room temperature.
8. Prepare pan by spraying with baking spray, and optionally making a parchment sling for easy removal.
9. Punch down, transfer to well floured surface. Divide into 16-32 portions. 
10. Roll each portion into a tight ball. Roll in melted coconut oil or butter, and put in the pan. All the rolls should be touching.
11. Optionally, sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds.
12. Sit at room temperature to rise until doubled.
13. Pre-heat oven to 350°F.
14. Put pan in oven for 25 minutes. Check for doneness (should be 200°F). Cook longer if needed.
15. Remove from pan, and cool on wire rack for at least a 15 minutes before serving.
