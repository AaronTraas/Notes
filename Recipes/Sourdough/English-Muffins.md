# Sourdough English Muffins

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoons (13g) granulated sugar
- 1 cups (227g) water, warm (110째F-115째F)
- 1/2 cup (115g) sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard; ripe will give you a more vigorous rise
- 3.5 cups (420g) unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (28g) nonfat dry milk
- 4 tablespoons (57g) butter, at room temperature
- 2 teaspoons (11g) kosher salt
- Coarse semolina flour or yellow cornmeal, for coating

## Directions

1. Combine all of the dough ingredients, except the cornmeal/semolina, in a large bowl.
2. Mix and knead to form a smooth dough. The dough should be soft and elastic, but not particularly sticky; add additional flour if necessary.
3. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover. If using discard and set it aside to rise at room tempurature for about 3 hours, or until it's noticeably puffy. For for ripe starter, bulk ferment a in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
4. Gently deflate the dough, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface, cover it, and let it sit for 10-20 minutes.
5. Divide the dough into 8-12 equal portions. Shape into ball, and flatten to 3-4" round. 
6. Place the rounds, evenly spaced, onto cornmeal- or semolina-sprinkled baking sheets. Sprinkle them with additional cornmeal/semolina, cover with plastic wrap, and let them rise until light and puffy, about 45 to 60 minutes. If the dough has been refrigerated overnight, the rise time will be about 2 hours.
7. Carefully transfer the rounds individually to a large electric griddle preheated to 350째F, or to an ungreased frying pan that has been preheated over medium-low heat.
9. Cook the muffins for about 10-12 minutes on their first side. Flip muffins, and cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until the center of a muffin registers 190째F. Check frequently to ensure muffins aren't burning. Adjust heat if necessary.
10. Remove the muffins from the griddle, and cool on a rack. 
11. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature for 4 or 5 days; freeze for longer storage.
