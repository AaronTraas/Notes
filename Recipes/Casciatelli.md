# Casciatelli

My great aunt always made these for Easter. It's a typical Easter treat from Molise. It appears related to the Sicilian Cassatelle. The pastry should be tender but a bit chewy, almost pasta-like, and very yellow in color. The filling has strong orange and mild anise flavor. 

I think these are much, much better when fresh. After a day or so, they lose a lot.

Pastry:
- 4 cups all purpose flour
- 4 eggs
- 1 stick butter
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup orange juice 

Filling:
- 3 eggs
- 3 lbs. ricotta
- 3/4 sugar
- zest of one orange
- 1 tbsp anisette
