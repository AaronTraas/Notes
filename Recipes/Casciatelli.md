# Casciatelli

My great aunt always made these for Easter. It's a typical Easter treat from Molise. It appears related to the Sicilian Cassatelle. The pastry should be tender but a bit chewy, almost pasta-like, and very yellow in color. The filling has strong orange and mild anise flavor. 

I think these are much, much better when fresh. After a day or so, they lose a lot.
