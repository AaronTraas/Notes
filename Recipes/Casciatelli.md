# Casciatelli

My great aunt always made these for Easter. It's a typical Easter treat from Molise. It appears related to the Sicilian Cassatelle. The pastry should be tender but a bit chewy, almost pasta-like, and very yellow in color. The filling has strong orange and mild anise flavor. 

I think these are much, much better when fresh. After a day or so, they lose a lot.

My great aunt told me that back in Monacilioni, they used to make a bit of extra pastry  and they'd make it into horses for the little boys, and dolls for the little girls. They'd bake it, and take it to mass on Easter morning. Before emass, the priest would bless it, and the young children would eat their treats.

## Ingredients:

Pastry:
- 4 cups all purpose flour
- 4 eggs
- 1 stick butter, melted
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup orange juice 

Filling:
- 3 eggs
- 3 lbs. ricotta
- 3/4 cup sugar
- zest of one orange
- 1 tbsp anisette

## Directions:

1. Pile the flour on your work surface. Make a large well in the middle. Add all the other ingredients to the well.
2. Mix the wet ingredients together with your fingers or a fork. Slowly incorporate all the flour into the mix. Knead by hand until homogeneous. Dough should be firm, not sticky. Add flour off too sticky.
3. Let dough rest for 15 minutes.
4. Knead until smooth.
5. Split into two portions, cover in bowl. Set aside.
6. Combine all ingredients for filling in a large bowl. Mix until smooth.
