# Bulgogi Marinade

This marinade is easy to make and very versatile. The puree of fruits and vegitables, as well as the sugar, really 
make for a flavorful marinade for thinly sliced beef, ground beef, or pork.

To use, simply marinade meat in the bulgogi marinade -- just enough to coat it in a vessel in the fridge. Alternatively, 
brown the meat and veggies, and add a cup or so of this sauce to it after it's 80% cooked, and reduce the sauce in the 
pan with the meat. Toss the finished dish with toasted sesame oil and garnish with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve 
with white rice. 

## Ingredients:

- 1 yellow onion
- 1 Korean pear (or Asian/Nashi pear) or red apple
- 1 kiwi
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 3 tbsp garlic
- 3 tbsp ginger
- Black pepper, to taste

## Instructions:

1. Peel and roughly chop the onion, pear, and kiwi.
2. Add all ingredients to blender. Blend until smooth.
3. Transfer to an airtight container. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 7 days, and freeze.

## Notes:

- Modified from [Aaron Huh's recipe](https://aaronandclaire.com/5-minute-bulgogi-korean-bbq-recipe/)
- I reduced the amount of water by half, doubled the amount of pear and kiwi.
- As suggested by Linda Allen-Poole, changed white sugar to brown sugar, which rounded out the flavor, and added ginger, which seemed to be missing.
