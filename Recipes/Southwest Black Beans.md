# "Mexican" Black Beans

This is tasty, easy, quick, and optionally meatless. The heavy lifting is done by the Goya Sazon. Really brainless and easy and tasty.

This is definitely better with the addition of bacon. Like, almost twice as good. Smoky pork fat makes a lot of things better. But still good without, and can be served on Fridays.

## Ingredients:
* 2 cans black beans
* 1 small onion, diced
* 2 cloves of garlic, lightly smashed
* 1 packet of Goya Sazón
* 2 tbsp neutral oil, lard, or bacon fat
* (optional) 1/4 lb bacon, diced
* (optional) fresh cliantro leaves

## Hardware:
* 3 quart stock pot or dutch oven
* large wooden spoon or silicone spatula

## Procedure:
1. If using bacon, cook bacon in pan to render fat. Otherwise, add other cooking fat.
2. Sautee onions until they start to turn translucent
3. Add garlic to pan and saute for 1 mintue or until fragrant
4. Add Sazón to pan. Stir until it's covered in the fat
5. Add beans to pan. Stir. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, until beans are sufficiently warmed up.
6. Serve, optionally with cilantro leaves as a garnish on top.
