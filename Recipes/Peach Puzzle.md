# Peach puzzle

  


  


INGREDIENTS  


Peaches and Syrup  


  * 7   medium peaches, peeled (see note)
  * 3/4cup packed light brown sugar
  * 6tablespoons water
  * 2tablespoons unsalted butter
  * 1/2tablespoon vanilla extract
  * 1/8teaspoon salt

Dough

  * 1 1/4cups all-purpose flour
  * 2tablespoons granulated sugar
  * 1tablespoon baking powder
  * 1/4teaspoon salt
  * 5tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces and chilled
  * 6tablespoons milk

INSTRUCTIONS

  * 1\. For the peaches and syrup: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Place 6-ounce custard cup or ramekin upside down in center of 9-inch pie plate and arrange peaches around ramekin (photo 1). Combine brown sugar, water, butter, vanilla, and salt in medium saucepan and stir over medium heat until sugar dissolves and butter melts, about 5 minutes. Pour syrup over peaches.

  * 2\. For the dough: Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in food processor until blended. Add butter and pulse until flour mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, five to six 1-second pulses. Turn mixture into medium bowl. (To make dough by hand: Use large holes on box grater to grate frozen butter into bowl with flour mixture, then rub flour-coated pieces between your fingers until flour mixture turns pale yellow and coarse.)

  * 3\. Using rubber spatula, fold milk into flour mixture, pressing mixture against sides of bowl to form dough. Squeeze dough together and flatten into disk. On lightly floured work surface, roll dough into 9-inch circle. Lay dough directly over peaches and press dough so that it fits snuggly around peaches (photo 2). The dough will stretch as you fit it around peaches, but do not attach dough to pie plate. Bake until top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on rack for 30 minutes.

  * 4\. Place large rimmed serving plate over top of pie plate and quickly invert Puzzle onto plate (photo 3). Cut into wedges around each peach and serve, pouring syrup over each portion.
