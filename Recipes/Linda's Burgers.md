# Linda's Burgers

## Ingredients

- ½ cup crushed saltine crackers or panko breadcrumbs
- 1 large egg
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp garlic powder

## Directions

1. Add all ingredients to a large mixing bowl. Mix by hand until mixture is smooth. 
2. Divide into 6 thick patties or 12 thin patties.
