Purchased multiple times at *[Florez Tobacconist](http://www.floreztobacconistnj.com/)* in Summit, NJ
Wedge shaped end. Full body. Medium strength and smooth. Really incredible.

**La Flor Dominica - Chapter One** wedge shaped end. Medium body. Dark, but smooth. No bitterness. Stronger nicotine than double ligero. Very good.

**Arturo Fuente - Gran Riserva** (some sort of short and thin variant)
