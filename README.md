# Aaron's public notes

This is a repository of Aaron's notes about the finer things in life. This is a perpetual work in progress. 

## What's in here

- **Recipes** - in the [Recipes](./Recipes/) folder. The stuff I've made multiple times is in the root of that folder. Stuff in [Untested](./Recipes/Untested) is stuff I intend to make, but haven't yet, so I can't certify that they are good. Note: my Italian dishes that I make aren't listed here, as they aren't really recipes, they are just things I know how to make. If you have questions about Southern Italian cuisine, just ask me.
- **Tobacco** - in the [Tobacco](./Tobacco/) folder. Split into seperate notes for cigars and pipe tobacco.
- **Adult Beverages** - in the [AdultBeverages](./AdultBeverages/) folder. Just Whisky for now. More to come.
