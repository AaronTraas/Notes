Opening scene:
- Story:
    - Great tone. Darker than Ara Fell, but with bits of levity. 
    - Characters I want to love introduced
    - Dialog very good; exposition driven by subtext
- UX
    - Music and sound effects are awesome
    - In-engine cut scene feels great
- Bugs:
    - "CREDIT #3" is displayed. Assume it's placeholder
    - Some sound effects have a faint female voice saying something I can't make out intertwined with them.

Scene 2 - exposition
- Story
    - Good exposition, clear, not too long.
    - 
- UX
    - Distortion in music at the peaks.
