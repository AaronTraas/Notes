General bugs:
- Bluetooth controller went to sleep while the game was paused. Re-activated controller, and the game didn't respond to controller. Worked with keyboard. Had to save the game, exit, and restart to get the controller working.
Opening scene:
- Story:
    - Great tone. Darker than Ara Fell, but with bits of levity. 
    - Characters I want to love introduced
    - Dialog very good; exposition driven by subtext
- UX
    - Music and sound effects are good
    - In-engine cut scene feels great
- Bugs:
    - "CREDIT #3" is displayed. Assume it's placeholder
    - Some sound effects have a faint female voice saying something I can't make out intertwined with them. "Audio jungle?" I assume that that's a watermark of sorts.

Scene 2 - exposition
- Story
    - Good exposition, clear, not too long.
- UX
    - Distortion in music at the peaks.
    - Battle missing some sound effects
    - Effects from Rowan's pisol attack linger a bit too long
    - Not super obvious after pressing the button to unlock the door, you have to press it again to open the door.
    - Got into a state where I was able to walk through walls and couldn't interact with anything. Had to re-load. The state was durable in the save game; I should have kept that save.

Scene 3 - killing rats
- Bugs:
    - The dialog after killing rats has numbers before some of the quotes that both main characters are saying.
