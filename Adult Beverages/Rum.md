# Rum

## Coconut rum

**Planteray Cut & Dry** - Good enough to sip. Toasted coconut, aged rum, banana notes. Really good. Complex. 

**Parrot bay 90 coconut** - like Malibu, but with the volume turned up. Strong coconut. A little sweet. Very hot ethanol. Not a refined product, but if you want something more potent than Malibu in a coctail, this is great.

## Coconut Liquers 

Malibu > Hampton Bay > Largo Bay

Honestly, it's not worth the savings to buy the off brands. Of course, I need to try more.
