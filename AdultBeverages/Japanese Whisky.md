| Ohishi Brandy Cask 10yr  | Rice Whisky | 41.7% | 6     | Mild woody scent. Very subtle. Tastes a little bit of burnt wood, thinned out maple syrup and butter. Incredibly clean and light. Delicate finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Ohishi Sakura Cask       | Rice Whisky | 43.6% | 7     | Mildly musty nose; woody, but not familiar. Slightly sweet. Pepper on the tip of the tongue, intensifies as it grows. Mildly sweet burnt sugar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Fukano 10yr              | Rice Whisky | 40.2% | 9     | Butterscotch and sandalwood, mild pear sweetness on the nose. Lots going on. Taste, has that sort of sweet oaky thing, but rather than straight vanilla like with American oak, there's something a bit different there -- a light buttery creaminess. Maybe faint creme brulee. There's a floral quality. Vague caramel-adjacent flavor. Builds during the finish - sharp at the tip of the tongue, round and rich towards the back. |
| Fukano 12yr              | Rice Whisky | 43.1% | 7     | Butterscotch and sandalwood, mild pear sweetness on the nose. Smells almost identical to the 10 year. Taskes a bit different. Harsher on the attack; more alcohol bite. Adds pepper and coconut. Finish very light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ohishi Islay Cask Finish | Rice Whisky | 42.8% |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
