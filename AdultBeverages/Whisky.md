| Ardbeg 10 Year           | Islay - Single Malt        | 46% | 5     | Light nose. PEAT!! Brine, alcohol. Slightly sweet. Rich in taste yet light bodied. Very smooth. Oddly simple and straight-forward, but not quite as much of a one-note punch in the face as Laphriog 10. My favorite of the batch, unsurprising.                                                                          |
| Ardbeg An Oa             | Islay - Single Malt        | 46% |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ardbeg Corryvreckan      | Islay - Single Malt        | 57% |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Ardbeg Uigeadail         | Islay - Single Malt        | 54% |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Auchentoshan 12 year     | Lowland - Single Malt      | 40% | 3     | Rough heat on the nose; atypical of Scotch. Sweet, smooth, and clean on the tongue. Strong notes of charred oak. The slightest burn at the back of the throat. Very good.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bowmore 12 Year          | Islay - Single Malt        | 40% | 3     | Very smokey, but otherwise somewhat bland. Very muted sweet and malt notes. Not much complexity. Smooth finish. It's probably the most unremarkable Islay I've tasted                                                                                                                                                     |
| Glenlivet 12 Year        | Speyside - Single Malt     | 40% | 3     | Slightly spicy, reminiscent of rye whiskey. Piney nose. Very nice, fairly basic. Very little smoke. A drop of water dilutes the interesting parts and makes it sweeter.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Glen Morangie 10 year    | Highland - Single Malt     | 43% | 2     | Sweet, light body. Strong caramel and vanilla on the nose. Slightly hot/alcoholic on the tongue. Water really dillutes the flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Glen Scotia Double Cask  | Campbelltown - Single Malt | 46% | 5     | Medium body. Burnt caramel, faint vanilla. Briny, very complex. Slight alcohol bite on the back of the palate. Fun to drink. Really excellent sipping whisky. I need this in my life.                                                                                                                                     |
| Lagavulin 16 Year        | Islay - Single Malt        | 43% | 5     | Smokey, strong peat, iodine, mild brine notes. Slightly sweat and musty, tastes of leather. Strong but well balanced. Smooth finish, slighly syrupy.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Lagavulin 12 Year        | Islay - Single Malt        |     | 4     | Smokey, strong peat, iodine, brine notes. Brighter and with more bite than the 16 year. Slightly sweat and slightly musty. Slightly rough finish. Benefits from a small amount of water                                                                                                                                   |
| Monkey Shoulder Batch 27 | Blended Malt Whisky        | 43% | 4     | Sweet, malty, vanilla, orange spice, both on the nose and the palate. Somewhat syrupy viscosity. Easy drinking. By far the best blend on the market, especially for the price. Much sweeter than most Scotch whiskies, more akin to a bourbon in sweetness. A little rough finish; it isn't a particularly mature whisky. |
| Talisker 10 Year         | Island - Single Malt       | 46% | 5     | Strong smell and taste of BBQ smoke. Slight burnt dried apricot, caramel, and orange zest. Brine and peat on the aftertaste. Incredibly strong but also balanced. Really fantastic and unique. A drop of water really opens it up.                                                                                        |
|                          |                            |     |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## American Whiskey
Note: I tend to like Scotch much better than American whiskey. The scores are in comparison to other American whiskey.

|---------------------------------|------------------|:---:|:-----:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basil Hayden                    | Straight Bourbon | 40% | 2     | Sweet, bland, uninteresting                                                                                                                                 |
| Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey | Wheat Whiskey    | 45% | 3     | Strong cereal feel on the tongue. Lots of nuts and fruit on the nose, less so on the tounge. Medium body. Oily. Interesting and unique.                     |
| Four Roses Small Batch          | Straight Bourbon | 45% | 4     | Hints of caramel, oak, vanilla, faint cherry, a bit peppery. Incredibly smooth. Light and subtle. Clean finish. Very enjoyable.                             |
| Jack Daniel's Single Barrel     | Tenessee Whiskey | 47% | 1     | Tastes like Jack Daniels No. 7, but with a little more going on. Still very sweet and harsh. Some bitter caramel. Light finish. Do not recommend.           |
| Maker's Mark                    | Straight Bourbon | 45% | 3     | Sweet, rich, vanilla, hint of orange. Smooth and easy to drink. Baseline "tastes like bourbon" bourbon. Enjoyable neat. Not terribly interesting, but good. |
| Old Forrester                   | Straight Rye     | 50% | 4     | Molasses and candied citrus on the nose. Pie spices For the money, the best American whiskey I've had to date.                                              |
| Old Overholt Bonded             | Straight Rye     | 50% |       |                                                                                                                                                             |
| Redemption Wheated Bourbon      | Wheated Bourbon  | 48% |       |                                                                                                                                                             |
