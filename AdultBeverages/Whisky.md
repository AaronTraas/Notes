| Bowmore 12 Year   | Islay - Single Malt | 40% | 3     | Very smokey, but otherwise somewhat bland. Very muted sweet and malt notes. Not much complexity. Smooth finish. It's probably the most unremarkable Islay I've tasted                                                                                        |
| Lagavulin 16 Year | Islay - Single Malt | 43% | 5     | Smokey, strong peat, iodine, mild brine notes. Slightly sweat and musty, tastes of leather. Strong but well balanced. Smooth finish, slighly syrupy.                                                                                                         |
| Lagavulin 12 Year | Islay - Single Malt |     | 4     | Smokey, strong peat, iodine, brine notes. Brighter and with more bite than the 16 year. Slightly sweat and slightly musty. Slightly rough finish. Benefits from a small amount of water                                                                      |
| Monkey Shoulder   | Blended             | 43% | 4     | Sweet, malty, vanilla, orange spice, both on the nose and the palate. Somewhat syrupy viscosity. Easy drinking. By far the best blend on the market, especially for the price. Much sweeter than most Scotch whiskies, more akin to a bourbon in sweetness.  |
