# Scotch Whisky:
Scores are on a 1-10. These scores are relative to each other, not to spirits in other catagories.

**Note about Aaron's tastes** â€“ I like intense flavors, lots of complexity. I strongly favor the typical profiles of Islay and Campbeltown scotch.

| Ardbeg 10 Year           | Islay - Single Malt        | 46% | 8     | Light nose. PEAT!! Brine, alcohol. Slightly sweet. Rich in taste yet light bodied. Very smooth. Oddly simple and straight-forward, but not quite as much of a one-note punch in the face as Laphriog 10.                                                                                                                  |
| Ardbeg An Oa             | Islay - Single Malt        | 46% | 8     | Very young, but tasty. Sweet and tart green apple notes both on the nose and the tongue. Slightly medicinal. Overall quite fruity and bright. Smokey, but less so than the 10 year. Very easy to drink. A little rough finish.                                                                                            |
| Ardbeg Corryvreckan      | Islay - Single Malt        | 57% | 8     | Much like the Uigeadail, but darker. The caramel notes taste slightly burnt, but in a pleasant way. Even more viscous mouthfeel. Almost a bit too much.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ardbeg Uigeadail         | Islay - Single Malt        | 54% | 9     | Musty caramel and smoke on the nose. Peppery bite on the tongue, sweet caramel/butterscotch. Peat smoke is strong, but rounded. Rich and velvety. Smooth, clean finish.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Auchentoshan 12 year     | Lowland - Single Malt      | 40% | 5     | Rough heat on the nose; atypical of Scotch. Sweet, smooth, and clean on the tongue. Strong notes of charred oak. The slightest burn at the back of the throat. Very good.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bowmore 12 Year          | Islay - Single Malt        | 40% | 5     | Very smokey, but otherwise somewhat bland. Very muted sweet and malt notes. Not much complexity. Smooth finish. It's probably the most unremarkable Islay I've tasted.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Glenlivet 12 Year        | Speyside - Single Malt     | 40% | 5     | Slightly spicy, reminiscent of rye whiskey. Piney nose. Very nice, fairly basic. Very little smoke. A drop of water dilutes the interesting parts and makes it sweeter.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Glen Morangie 10 year    | Highland - Single Malt     | 43% | 4     | Sweet, light body. Strong caramel and vanilla on the nose. Slightly hot/alcoholic on the tongue. Water really dilutes the flavor.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Glen Scotia Double Cask  | Campbelltown - Single Malt | 46% | 9     | Burnt caramel, faint vanilla and green apple. Medium body, brandy-like richness. Briny, very complex. Slight alcohol bite on the back of the palate. Fun to drink. Really excellent sipping whisky. I need this in my life.                                                                                               |
| Lagavulin 16 Year        | Islay - Single Malt        | 43% | 10    | Smokey, strong peat, iodine, mild brine notes. Slightly sweat and musty, tastes of leather. Strong but well balanced. Smooth finish, slighly syrupy. To me, this is the sweet spot - this is the whisky I want to drink most of the time, especially in fall and winter.                                                  |
| Lagavulin 12 Year        | Islay - Single Malt        |     | 8     | Smokey, strong peat, iodine, brine notes. Brighter and with more bite than the 16 year. Slightly sweat and slightly musty. A lot going on. Slightly rough finish on account of the cask strength. Slightly rough finish. Benefits from a few of water.                                                                    |
| Monkey Shoulder Batch 27 | Blended Malt Whisky        | 43% | 6     | Sweet, malty, vanilla, orange spice, both on the nose and the palate. Somewhat syrupy viscosity. Easy drinking. By far the best blend on the market, especially for the price. Much sweeter than most Scotch whiskies, more akin to a bourbon in sweetness. A little rough finish; it isn't a particularly mature whisky. |
| Talisker 10 Year         | Island - Single Malt       | 46% | 9     | Strong smell and taste of BBQ smoke. Slight burnt dried apricot, caramel, and orange zest. Brine and peat on the aftertaste. Incredibly strong but also balanced. Really fantastic and unique. A drop of water really opens it up.                                                                                        |
|                          |                            |     |       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
