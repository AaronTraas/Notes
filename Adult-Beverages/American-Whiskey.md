| Balcones Texas Single Malt      | Single Malt Whiskey | 53% | 9     | Rich, slightly sweet, malty whiskey. Flavor explosion in the mouth. Intense. The high proof does it a lot of favors. Not quite as refined as a more aged Irish or Scotch, but really lovely.                                                                                       |
| Basil Hayden                    | Straight Bourbon    | 40% | 4     | Sweet, bland, uninteresting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Bernheim Original Wheat Whiskey | Wheat Whiskey       | 45% | 5     | Strong cereal feel on the tongue. Lots of nuts and fruit on the nose, less so on the tounge. Medium body. Oily. Interesting and unique.                                                                                                                                            |
| Buffalo Trace                   | Straight Bourbon    | 45% | 8     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Del Bac Dorado                  | Single Malt Whiskey | 46% | 8     | Unlike anything else I've had. Sweet, smokey, malty. Caramel and toffee notes. Different from peat smoke; does not register as Scotch-like. Hint of BBQ, but not overwhelming. Soft finish. Thanks to [johndrothe](https://github.com/johndrothe) for sharing!                     |
| Four Roses Small Batch          | Straight Bourbon    | 45% | 7     | Hints of caramel, oak, vanilla, faint cherry, a bit peppery. Incredibly smooth. Light and subtle. Clean finish. Very enjoyable.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Jack Daniel's Single Barrel     | Tenessee Whiskey    | 47% | 3     | Tastes like Jack Daniels No. 7, but with a little more going on. Still very sweet and harsh. Some bitter caramel. Light finish. Do not recommend.                                                                                                                                  |
| Maker's Mark                    | Straight Bourbon    | 45% | 5     | Sweet, rich, vanilla, hint of orange. Smooth and easy to drink. Baseline "tastes like bourbon" bourbon. Enjoyable neat. Not terribly interesting, but good.                                                                                                                        |
| Old Forrester                   | Straight Rye        | 50% | 7     | Molasses and candied citrus on the nose. Balanced rye spiciness, with warming pie spices undertone. Sweet but not too sweet. Slight bit bitter. Medium body. Makes a fantastic Old Fashioned. Priced at ~$25 a bottle, it makes an excellent every day drinking whiskey.           |
| Old Overholt Bonded             | Straight Rye        | 50% | 6     | Hints of caramel, rye, and butterscotch on the nose. Tastes likewise of caramel, oak, rye pepperiness, and vanilla. None of the notes are particularly strong or deep. Competent, but not exceptional rye. I doubt I'll be picking up more because Old Forrester is simply better. |
