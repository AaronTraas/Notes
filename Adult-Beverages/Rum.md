# Rum

## Coconut Rum

**Planteray Cut & Dry** - ABV 40%. Good enough to sip. Toasted coconut, aged rum, banana notes. Really good. Complex. 

**Parrot Bay 90 Coconut** - ABV 45%. Like Malibu, but with the volume turned up. Strong coconut. A little sweet. Very hot ethanol. Not a refined product, but if you want something more potent than Malibu in a coctail, this is great.

## Coconut Liquer

Though these claim to be coconut rums, they are low proof (usually around 20% ABV) and have a large amount of sugar added, beyond the typical _"dosage"_ added to many rums.

Malibu > Hampton Bay > Largo Bay

Honestly, it's not worth the savings to buy the off brands. Of course, I need to try more.
