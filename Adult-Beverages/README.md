## Tasting Notes

I don't always add everything here; I wish I were more diligent. Please understand that this is to my taste, not attempting to be some sort of objective rating of any kind. I like what I like. Also, the numeric rating of each is relative to its catagory. All things being equal, I prefer Scotch whisky to all other spirits.

## Cocktail Recipes

Cocktail recipes I use, but not necessarily created, that are a little outside the classics. These work for me, and are catered to my tastes and the tastes of the people I love to drink with.
